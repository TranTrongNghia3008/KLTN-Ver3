0	While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS- CoV-2 chimeric virus.	Measuring sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses	entailment	REFUTED

4	IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS- CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. CONCLUSIONS IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years.	Long-term persistence of igg antibodies in sars-cov infected healthcare workers	entailment	SUPPORTED
