    "     - **label = false**\n",
    "     - and stop. Do not proceed to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate the factual accuracy** of the statement using only the reference materials:\n",

In the mid-1990s, he found work with the animation production company DIC Entertainment through an Omaha casting call. He was subsequently cast in a number of their television productions in main voice roles.  He continued to work in the medium for a number of years while pursuing theater. Rannells worked with the New York City-based production company 4Kids Entertainment from 2001 to 2004 and did voice acting for several English dubs of anime series such as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!,  in addition to serving as voice director for the dubs of Kirby: Right Back at Ya! and Sonic X.  One of his first theater roles was as the character James in the touring production of Pokémon Live! from September 2000 to August 2001. When asked about his experience in 2014, he jokingly said that he would have rather starred in a porn film or snuff film  instead and that he only took the job for the pay.   In his 2019 memoir Too Much Is Not Enough: A Memoir of Fumbling Toward Adulthood, Rannells admitted that playing James on Pokemon Live! was a miserable experience, as he found the character to be an offensive depiction of a gay man. Being a gay man himself, he felt the role was not only a hurtful insult towards his orientation, but also a bad role model for any gay kid who watched the show when it was on tour. He also admitted that he only starred in the show because he was broke and needed the paycheck.  Before winning his first Broadway role, Rannells had parts in a number of regional theater productions, including Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Miss Saigon, and Thoroughly Modern Millie.  For his turn as Hedwig at the Zachary Scott Theater Center in Austin, Texas, in 2002,  he won best actor in a musical at the B.

In January 2009, he reprised the role of Gaudio in the musical\\'s Broadway production.  In 2011, Rannells originated the role of Elder Price in The Book of Mormon, a musical written by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and Avenue Q composer Robert Lopez. For his performance, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. He won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album for his performance in the musical\\'s Original Broadway Cast Recording.

It develops your characters and it makes the story more engaging.\\nIt’s not easy to do all these things at once, but when you master the art of writing dialogue, readers won’t be able to put your book down.\\nIn this article, we will teach you the rules for writing dialogue and share our top dialogue tips that will make your story sing.\\nBefore we look at tips for writing powerful dialogue, let’s start with an overview of basic dialogue rules.\\nLet’s walk through some examples of how to format dialogue.\\nThe simplest formatting option is to write a line of speech without a dialogue tag. In this case, the entire line of speech goes within the quotation marks, including the period at the end.\\nAnother common formatting option is to write a single line of speech that ends with a dialogue tag.\\nHere, you should separate the speech from the dialogue tag with a comma, which should go inside the quotation marks.\\nYou can also write a line of speech that starts with a dialogue tag. Again, you separate the dialogue tag with a comma, but this time, the comma goes outside the quotation marks.\\nAs an alternative to a simple dialogue tag, you can write a line of speech accompanied by an action beat. In this case, you should use a period rather than a comma, because the action beat is a full sentence.\\nFinally, you can choose to include an action beat while the character is talking.\\nIn this case, you would use em-dashes to separate the action from the dialogue, to indicate that the action happens without a pause in the speech.\\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, we can move on to the more nuanced aspects of writing dialogue.\\nHere are our seven favorite tips for writing strong, powerful dialogue that will keep your readers engaged.\\nDialogue is a great way to reveal your characters. What your characters say, and how they say it, can tell us so much about what kind of people they are.\\nSome characters are witty and gregarious. Others are timid and unobtrusive.\\nSpeech patterns vary drastically from person to person.\\nTo make someone stop talking to them, one character might say “I would rather not talk about this right now,” while another might say, “Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.”\\nWhen you’re writing dialogue, think about your character’s education level, personality, and interests.\\nEach character should have their own voice.\\nIdeally, you want to write dialogue that lets your reader identify the person speaking at any point in your story just by looking at what’s between the quotation marks.\\nGood dialogue should sound natural. Listen to how people talk in real life and try to replicate it on the page when you write dialogue.\\nDon’t be afraid to break the rules of grammar, or to use an occasional exclamation point to punctuate dialogue.\\nIt’s okay to use contractions, sentence fragments, and run-on sentences, even if you wouldn’t use them in other parts of the story.\\nThis doesn’t mean that realistic dialogue should sound exactly like the way people speak in the real world.\\nIf you’ve ever read a court transcript, you know that real-life speech is riddled with “ums” and “ahs” and repeated words and phrases. A few paragraphs of this might put your readers to sleep.\\nCompelling dialogue should sound like a real conversation, while still being wittier, smoother, and better worded than real speech.\\nA dialogue tag is anything that tells the reader which character is talking within that same paragraph, such as “she said” or “I asked.”\\nWhen you’re writing dialogue, remember that simple dialogue tags are the most effective.\\nOften, you can omit dialogue tags after the conversation has started flowing, especially if only two characters are participating.\\nThe reader will be able to keep up with who’s speaking as long as you start a new paragraph each time the speaker changes.\\nWhen you do need to use a dialogue tag, a simple “he said” or “she said” will do the trick.\\nOur brains generally skip over the word “said” when we’re reading, while other dialogue tags are a distraction.\\nA common mistake beginner writers make is to avoid using the word “said.”\\nCharacters in amateur novels tend to mutter, whisper, declare, or chuckle at every line of dialogue. This feels overblown and distracts from the actual story.\\nAnother common mistake is to attach an adverb to the word “said.” Characters in amateur novels rarely just say things—they have to say things loudly, quietly, cheerfully, or angrily.\\nIf you’re writing great dialogue, readers should be able to figure out whether your character is cheerful or angry from what’s within the quotation marks.\\nThe only exception to this rule is if the dialogue tag contradicts the dialogue itself. For example, consider this sentence:\\nThe word “angrily” is redundant here because the words inside the quotation marks already imply that the character is speaking angrily.\\nIn contrast, consider this sentence:\\nHere, the word “thoughtfully” is well-placed because it contrasts with what we might otherwise assume. It adds an additional nuance to the sentence inside the quotation marks.\\nYou can use the ProWritingAid dialogue check when you write dialogue to make sure your dialogue tags are pulling their weight and aren’t distracting readers from the main storyline.\\nSign up for your free ProWritingAid account to check your dialogue tags today.\\nWhen you’re writing dialogue, you can use action beats—descriptions of body language or physical action—to show what each character is doing throughout the conversation.\\nLearning how to write action beats is an important component of learning how to write dialogue.\\nGood dialogue becomes even more interesting when the characters are doing something active at the same time.\\nYou can watch people in real life, or even characters in movies, to see what kinds of body language they have. Some pick at their fingernails. Some pace the room. Some tap their feet on the floor.\\nIncluding physical action when writing dialogue can have multiple benefits:\\nYou can decide how often to include physical descriptions in each scene. All dialogue has an ebb and flow to it, and you can use beats to control the pace of your dialogue scenes.\\nIf you want a lot of tension in your scene, you can use fewer action beats to let the dialogue ping-pong back and forth.\\nIf you want a slower scene, you can write dialogue that includes long, detailed action beats to help the reader relax.\\nYou should start a separate sentence, or even a new paragraph, for each of these longer beats.\\nEvery conversation has subtext, because we rarely say exactly what we mean. The best dialogue should include both what is said and what is not said.\\nI once had a roommate who cared a lot about the tidiness of our apartment, but would never say it outright. We soon figured out that whenever she said something like “I might bring some friends over tonight,” what she meant was “Please wash your dishes, because there are no clean plates left for my friends to use.”\\nWhen you’re writing dialogue, it’s important to think about what’s not being said. Even pleasant conversations can hide a lot beneath the surface.\\nIs one character secretly mad at the other?\\nIs one secretly in love with the other?\\nIs one thinking about tomorrow’s math test and only pretending to pay attention to what the other person is saying?\\nPersonally, I find it really hard to use subtext when I write dialogue from scratch.\\nIn my first drafts I let my characters say what they really mean. Then, when I’m editing, I go back and figure out how to convey the same information through subtext instead.\\nWhen I was in high school, I once wrote a story in which the protagonist’s mother tells her: “As you know, Susan, your dad left us when you were five.”\\nI’ve learned a lot about the writing craft since high school, but it doesn’t take a brilliant writer to figure out that this is not something any mother would say to her daughter in real life.\\nThe reason I wrote that line of dialogue was because I wanted to tell the reader when Susan last saw her father, but I didn’t do it in a realistic way.\\nDon’t shoehorn information into your characters’ conversations if they’re not likely to say it to each other.\\nOne useful trick is to have your characters get into an argument.\\nYou can convey a lot of information about a topic through their conflicting opinions, without making it sound like either of the characters is saying things for the reader’s benefit.\\nHere’s one way my high school self could have conveyed the same information in a more realistic way in just a few lines:\\nSusan: “Why didn’t you tell me Dad was leaving? Why didn’t you let me say goodbye?”\\nMom: “You were only five. I wanted to protect you.”\\nDialogue tends to flow out easily when you’re drafting your story, so in the editing process, you’ll need to be ruthless. Cut anything that doesn’t move the story forward.\\nTry not to write dialogue that feels like small talk.\\nYou can eliminate most hellos and goodbyes, or summarize them instead of showing them. Readers don’t want to waste their time reading dialogue that they hear every day.\\nIn addition, try not to write dialogue with too many trigger phrases, which are questions that trigger the next line of dialogue, such as:\\nIt’s tempting to slip these in when you’re writing dialogue because they keep the conversation flowing. I still catch myself doing this from time to time.\\nRemember that you don’t need three lines of dialogue when one line could accomplish the same thing.\\nLet’s look at some dialogue examples from successful novels that follow each of our seven tips.\\nLet’s start with an example of a character with a distinct voice from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling.\\n“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field.\\nRon gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front.\\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. “Can you hold him still, Harry?”\\nMost readers could figure out that this was Colin Creevey speaking, even if his name hadn’t been mentioned in the passage.\\nThis is because Colin Creevey is the only character who speaks with such extreme enthusiasm, even at a time when Ron is belching slugs.\\nThis snippet of written dialogue does a great job of showing us Colin’s personality and how much he worships his hero Harry.\\nHere’s an example of how to write dialogue that feels realistic from A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini.\\n“As much as I love this land, some days I think about leaving it,” Babi said.\\n“Where to?”\\n“Anyplace where it’s easy to forget. Pakistan first, I suppose. For a year, maybe two. Wait for our paperwork to get processed.”\\n“And then?”\\n“And then, well, it is a big world. Maybe America. Somewhere near the sea. Like California.”\\nNotice the punctuation and grammar that these two characters use when they speak.\\nThere are many sentence fragments in this conversation like, “Anyplace where it’s easy to forget.” and “Somewhere near the sea.”\\nBabi often omits the verbs from his sentences, just like people do in real life. He speaks in short fragments instead of long, flowing paragraphs.\\nThis dialogue shows who Babi is and feels similar to the way a real person would talk, while still remaining concise.\\nHere’s an example of effective dialogue tags in Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier.\\nIn this passage, the narrator’s been caught exploring the forbidden west wing of her new husband’s house, and she’s trying to make excuses for being there.\\n“I lost my way,” I said, “I was trying to find my room.”\\n“You have come to the opposite side of the house,” she said; “this is the west wing.”\\n“Yes, I know,” I said.\\n“Did you go into any of the rooms?” she asked me.\\n“No,” I said. “No, I just opened a door, I did not go in. Everything was dark, covered up in dust sheets. I’m sorry. I did not mean to disturb anything. I expect you like to keep all this shut up.”\\n“If you wish to open up the rooms I will have it done,” she said; “you have only to tell me. The rooms are all furnished, and can be used.”\\n“Oh, no,” I said. “No. I did not mean you to think that.”\\nIn this passage, the only dialogue tags Du Maurier uses are “I said,” “she said,” and “she asked.”\\nEven so, you can feel the narrator’s dread and nervousness. Her emotions are conveyed through what she actually says, rather than through the dialogue tags.\\nThis is a splendid example of evocative speech that doesn’t need fancy dialogue tags to make it come to life.\\nLet’s look at a passage from The Princess Bride by William Goldman, where dialogue is melded with physical action.\\nWith a smile the hunchback pushed the knife harder against Buttercup’s throat. It was about to bring blood. “If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving,\" Vizzini said.\\nThe man in black froze.\\n“Better,” Vizzini nodded.\\nNo sound now beneath the moonlight.\\n“I understand completely what you are trying to do,” the Sicilian said finally, “and I want it quite clear that I resent your behavior. You are trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen, and I think it quite ungentlemanly.”\\n“Let me explain,” the man in black began, starting to edge forward.\\n“You’re killing her!” the Sicilian screamed, shoving harder with the knife. A drop of blood appeared now at Buttercup’s throat, red against white.\\nIn this passage, William Goldman brings our attention seamlessly from the action to the dialogue and back again.\\nThis makes the scene twice as interesting, because we’re paying attention not just to what Vizzini and the man in black are saying, but also to what they’re doing.\\nThis is a great way to keep tension high and move the plot forward.\\nThis example from Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card shows how to write dialogue with subtext.\\nHere is the scene when Ender and his sister Valentine are reunited for the first time, after Ender’s spent most of his childhood away from home training to be a soldier.\\nEnder didn’t wave when she walked down the hill toward him, didn’t smile when she stepped onto the floating boat slip. But she knew that he was glad to see her, knew it because of the way his eyes never left her face.\\n“You’re bigger than I remembered,” she said stupidly.\\n“You too,” he said. “I also remembered that you were beautiful.”\\n“Memory does play tricks on us.”\\n“No. Your face is the same, but I don’t remember what beautiful means anymore. Come on. Let’s go out into the lake.”\\nIn this scene, we can tell that Valentine missed her brother terribly, and that Ender went through a lot of trauma at Battle School, without either of them saying it outright.\\nThe conversation could have started with Valentine saying “I missed you,” but instead, she goes for a subtler opening: “You’re bigger than I remembered.”\\nSimilarly, Ender could say “You have no idea what I’ve been through,” but instead he says, “I don’t remember what beautiful means anymore.”\\nWe can deduce what each of these characters is thinking and feeling from what they say and from what they leave unsaid.\\nLet’s look at an example from The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. This scene is the story’s first introduction of the ancient creatures called the Chandrian.\\n“I didn’t know the Chandrian were demons,” the boy said. “I’d heard—”\\n“They ain’t demons,” Jake said firmly. “They were the first six people to refuse Tehlu’s choice of the path, and he cursed them to wander the corners—”\\n“Are you telling this story, Jacob Walker?” Cob said sharply. “Cause if you are, I’ll just let you get on with it.”\\nThe two men glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually Jake looked away, muttering something that could, conceivably, have been an apology.\\nCob turned back to the boy. “That’s the mystery of the Chandrian,” he explained. “Where do they come from? Where do they go after they’ve done their bloody deeds? Are they men who sold their souls? Demons? Spirits? No one knows.” Cob shot Jake a profoundly disdainful look. “Though every half-wit claims he knows...”\\nThe three characters taking part in this conversation all know what the Chandrian are.\\nImagine if Cob had said “As we all know, the Chandrian are mysterious demon-spirits.” We would feel like he was talking to us, not to the two other characters.\\nInstead, Rothfuss has all three characters try to explain their own understanding of what the Chandrian are, and then shoot each other’s explanations down.\\nWhen Cob reprimands Jake for interrupting him and then calls him a half-wit for claiming to know what he’s talking about, it feels like a realistic interaction.\\nThis is a clever way for Rothfuss to introduce the Chandrian in a believable way.\\nHere’s an example of concise dialogue from The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger.\\n“Do you blame me for flunking you, boy?” he said.\\n“No, sir! I certainly don’t,” I said. I wished to hell he’d stop calling me “boy” all the time.\\nHe tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it. Only, he missed again, naturally. I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the Atlantic Monthly. It’s boring to do that every two minutes.\\n“What would you have done in my place?” he said. “Tell the truth, boy.”\\nWell, you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me. So I shot the bull for a while. I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff. I told him how I would’ve done exactly the same thing if I’d been in his place, and how most people didn’t appreciate how tough it is being a teacher. That kind of stuff. The old bull.\\nHere, the last paragraph diverges from the prior ones. After the teacher says “Tell the truth, boy,” the rest of the conversation is summarized, rather than shown.\\nThe summary of what the narrator says in the last paragraph—“I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff”—serves to hammer home that this is the type of “old bull” that the narrator has fed to his teachers over and over before.\\nIt doesn’t need to be shown because it’s not important to the narrator—it’s just “all that stuff.”\\nSalinger could have written out the entire conversation in dialogue, but instead he kept the dialogue concise.\\nNow you know how to write clear, effective dialogue!

Unlike formal hierarchies and official channels, informal networks are based on relationships, trust, and shared interests among employees. In this guide, we’ll explore what an example of an informal network looks like and how it functions within an organization.\\n1. Employee Friendships\\nOne common example of an informal network is employee friendships. In a workplace, employees often form bonds and friendships with their colleagues. These relationships extend beyond work-related tasks and can involve shared interests, hobbies, or even personal experiences. These friendships create informal connections that can facilitate the flow of information and collaboration.\\n2. Communities of Practice\\nCommunities of practice are informal networks within organizations where individuals with similar professional interests come together to share knowledge and expertise. For instance, in a software development company, developers may form a community of practice to exchange ideas, discuss best practices, and solve common problems. These networks enhance learning and innovation.\\n3. Mentorship Relationships\\nMentorship relationships are a prime example of informal networks that benefit both junior and senior employees. When a more experienced employee mentors a newer colleague, they create a valuable informal connection. Through mentorship, knowledge is transferred, and career development is fostered.\\n4. Information Sharing Groups\\nInformal networks often include information sharing groups or networks where employees share updates, news, and insights related to their roles or industry trends. For example, a group of sales professionals may have an informal network for sharing sales tactics and market insights, helping each other stay informed and competitive.\\n5. Social Media and Online Forums\\nIn the digital age, informal networks can extend beyond the physical workplace. Employees may connect with colleagues through social media platforms or online forums related to their industry. These virtual networks enable easy communication and information exchange, even when team members are geographically dispersed.\\n6. Cross-Departmental Connections\\nEmployees don’t limit their informal networks to their immediate teams or departments. Cross-departmental connections often form as employees interact with colleagues from other areas of the organization. These connections can be valuable for sharing diverse perspectives and solving complex problems.\\n7. Lunchtime or Coffee Break Gatherings\\nInformal networks can also manifest during lunch breaks or coffee breaks. Colleagues may gather for informal discussions, share experiences, or brainstorm ideas. These casual interactions build camaraderie and foster collaboration.\\n8. Alumni Networks\\nIn some organizations, former employees who maintain ties with their former colleagues create informal alumni networks. These networks can be a valuable source of industry insights, referrals, and collaboration opportunities.\\n9. Industry Events and Conferences\\nAttending industry events and conferences can lead to the formation of informal networks. Employees may meet professionals from other organizations, exchange contact information, and stay in touch for future collaborations or information sharing.\\n10. Volunteer or Social Activities\\nParticipating in volunteer or social activities organized by the company can also lead to the development of informal networks. These activities provide opportunities for employees to interact in a relaxed setting, strengthening their relationships.\\nConclusion\\nInformal networks are a dynamic and essential part of organizational communication. Examples of informal networks include employee friendships, communities of practice, mentorship relationships, information sharing groups, and connections formed through social media, cross-departmental interactions, and industry events. These networks facilitate knowledge sharing, collaboration, and the exchange of valuable insights. Understanding and leveraging these informal networks can contribute to a more vibrant and connected workplace.\\nInformal communication is a crucial aspect of effective communication in various settings, whether it’s for personal relationships, social interactions, or even in the business world.

Employee Friendships\\nOne common example of an informal network is employee friendships. In a workplace, employees often form bonds and friendships with their colleagues.

Employees may meet professionals from other organizations, exchange contact information, and stay in touch for future collaborations or information sharing.\\n10.

This suggests a mature Christian community that has been well-instructed. The phrase underscores the necessity of continual reinforcement of spiritual truths, as human nature is prone to forgetfulness and distraction. This aligns with the biblical principle found in Deuteronomy 6:6-9, where God\\'s commands are to be constantly taught and remembered.\\nand are established in the truth you now have\\nThe term \"established\" indicates a firm foundation in the faith, suggesting that the recipients of the letter have a solid understanding and acceptance of the gospel. This reflects the early church\\'s emphasis on doctrinal stability amidst false teachings, a theme prevalent in the epistle. The \"truth you now have\" points to the apostolic teaching and the gospel message, which is consistent with the truth revealed in Jesus Christ (John 14:6). This phrase reassures believers of their secure position in Christ, encouraging them to remain vigilant against heresies.\\n(12) I will not be negligent.--According to the right reading, I shall be sure to; because on your doing these things depends your entrance into Christ\\'s kingdom.\\nThough ye know them.--We find the same affectionate delicacy in Romans 15:14-15 (see Notes there); 1John 2:21; Jude 1:5.\\nAnd be established in the present truth.--Comp. \"This is the true grace of God wherein ye stand\" (1Peter 5:12), to which it is not impossible that this verse refers; the \"always\" here looks like a half apology for what his readers might think needless repetition. \"The present truth\" is an instance of a translation being misleading through its very literalness. The three Greek words are exactly represented, but the sense is misrepresented. The meaning is, not the truth that we are now discussing, the truth before us, but the truth of the gospel that is come unto you (Colossians 1:5-6), and is present with you: \"the faith once for all delivered unto the saints\" (Jude 1:3). . . .\\n\\n### This was likely said in a casu\\nParticipants in a formal discussion would most likely A.)use everyday language suitable for a casual conversation.

For now, just focus on ONE thing–noticing and understanding.\\nBusiness Negotiations in English: A dialogue.\\nYOU: Hello, it’s great to meet you in person so we can talk about your new project.\\xa0 Can you tell me a little more? What would you like to accomplish?\\n\\nYOUR CLIENT: We’d like to offer training to all of our staff. We want them to be great negotiators!\\nYOU: That sounds like a wonderful idea. And how we can help you reach your goals?\\nYOUR CLIENT: What we’re interested in is a full-time immersion for our entire team. We’d like to focus on just this skill for one week at least.\\nYOU: So, if I understand you correctly, you’d like your entire sales team to focus only on this training, during all of their normal working hours. For a week. Or perhaps more. Is that right?\\nYOUR CLIENT: Yes, but we can only do that during one of the weeks when business is usually slow. But yes, that’s the idea.\\nYOU: That’s definitely something we can do. We can offer you a one-week training session for your entire sales team, during your slow season.\\xa0 We’ll add a second trainer so that your team can work in small groups. How does that sound?\\nYOUR CLIENT: It sounds great.\\xa0 But since we’re a large team and we are planning our training well in advance, I was wondering if you could also provide us with an extra session on negotiations in English. For the same price…\\nYOU: That’s a fair suggestion. We could offer you the English training during your week-long training free of charge.\\nYOUR CLIENT: Perfect. I think that’s everything.\\nYOU: I think we have a deal. I’m looking forward to working with you.\\nAlso check out my lesson: Words you need to know to understand a meeting in English.\\nNow that you’ve had a chance to listen to this short negotiation in English, let’s talk about those expressions you heard. That way, you’ll be able to use them too.\\nWe’re going to begin with phrases that will help you listen to your client and understand what he/she wants.\\nOf course, you’ll want to know exactly what your client wants to gain from working with you. Here are some phrases you can use:\\n1. To find out what your client wants to do try one of these expressions:\\nWhat would you like to do?\\nWhat would you like to achieve/accomplish?\\nWhat are your goals?\\n2. To ask what your client wants from you or your company, you can use one of these:\\nWhat do you expect from our company?\\nWhat do you expect from our work together?\\nHow can we help you reach your goals?\\n3. To find out what your client wants to say more precisely, or to clarify, use these expressions:\\nWhat do you mean by _______(a word usually).\\nFor example:\\nWhat do you mean by full-time training? How many hours a week would that be for your team?\\nWhen you say ____ what do you mean?\\nFor example:\\nWhen you say you’d like an immersive training experience, what do you mean by that exactly? Can you tell me more?\\nNow that you understand what your client wants to gain by working with you, you’re ready for the next step. Asking what they think of your offer!\\nIn your negotiation, you’ll definitely want to ask your client his or her opinion. Here are some professional ways you can do that:\\n4.\\xa0 What do you think…\\nYes, it really is quite simple this time! You could ask,\\nWhat do you think about that?\\nWhat do you think about our offer (our proposal? the plan I’ve presented/ the schedule…)\\n5.\\xa0 Or you could use an expression very common with native speakers to find out what your client thinks:\\nHow does that sound?\\nHow does that sound to you?\\nHow does a free training session sound to you?\\nThis is another way of asking your client what they think.\\n6.\\xa0 If your client is hesitating, and you want them to make a suggestion ask this:\\nThis expression isn’t in the dialogue, but you might need it someday.\\nMaybe you can see that the negotiations are not moving forward as you’d like.\\nYou’d like your client to be clear about what he or she would need to work with you.\\nHere’s an extra expression you could try:\\nWhat would it take for us to be able to work with you?\\nWhat would it take for this proposal to work for you?\\nAsking this can help the person you’re negotiating with make suggestions that can help the negotiation. You both win!\\nMaybe you’ll even start to agree on some details.\\nSo it might be time to close the negotiation.\\nAlso check out my lesson: How to pitch your business in conversations in English.\\nAfter all that hard work, you’ll want to make sure you know how to close your negotiation with confidence!\\nHere are some phrases you can learn to make sure everyone understands. And your work together starts off well:\\n7.\\xa0 To make sure everyone understands your agreement try one of these:\\nI would like to clarify our position.\\xa0 (And then you explain anything you need to).\\nOR you can say,\\nJust to clarify… (And then restate what you understood from the conversation.)\\n8.\\xa0 To show your client you understand his or her point and you agree with their suggestion, say:\\nThat’s a fair suggestion.\\nYou could follow up by making some suggestions that will help your client accept your offer.\\nWe could….\\nWe are prepared to…\\nWhat we could do is…\\n9.\\xa0 And if everything goes well, you get to close your negotiation with one of these phrases:\\nIt’s a deal.\\nWe have a deal.\\nI think we have a deal.\\nAlso check out my lesson: How to prepare better conversations in English and save time too.\\nThe best way to become more confident using Business English is to practice!\\nHere’s your weekly challenge for this week:\\nIf you learned something from this lesson, please share it with your coworkers & friends.

Read our Privacy notice\\nB\\nill Hader appears on my screen from Los Angeles, unshaven, a little groggy and in an uncluttered white room. Faced with this pixelated version of him, I’m instantly reminded of his role in the 2008 Judd Apatow-produced romcom Forgetting Sarah Marshall, for which he appeared almost exclusively on video call, in the days before Zoom was a thing. “It was such a novelty back then,” he says, that furrowed brow unmistakeable. “It was like, ‘Whoa, this is new.’”\\nSaturday Night Live’s erstwhile Man of a Thousand Faces is here on my laptop to talk about his greatest creation, Barry Berkman, a marine turned assassin turned aspiring actor in the HBO comedy-drama Barry, which Hader writes and directs as well as playing the title character. The show has won multiple Emmys; critical adulation; obsessive fans. What began as an apparent riff on the hitman-with-a-heart-of-gold trope has evolved over four seasons into something richer: a thrilling synthesis of showbiz satire and character study, with pitch-black humour and nail-biting suspense. As we get to know Barry, the notion of him as simply a stoic, ruthlessly efficient killer slowly dissipates.\\n“I like the John Wick movies,” says Hader. “But this wasn’t John Wick. This wasn’t ‘assassin’ in a genre sense.” The show was more about “the real idea of a hitman”, he explains. “The loneliness of it, and how murdering people affects his psyche.” Hader points to Tony Gilroy’s 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton as an example of how to get hitmen right. “I liked that scene when Tom Wilkinson gets killed,” he says. (The hitmen make the attorney’s murder appear to be suicide.) “I always thought that was a good, realistic fixer hit scene. It was so shocking.”\\nHader’s face is an orchestra of expressions, all quivering eyebrows, wolfish smiles, and grimaces played for laughs. He is dry and laconic, with a midwestern accent that flits between adenoidal and baritone. He is also, by his own admission, a bundle of anxiety, which seems to manifest itself in moments of quiet self-effacement or hyper-critical introspection. Maybe it’s no surprise, then, that Barry so successfully probes the darkest corners of the human condition while retaining a gloriously offbeat sense of humour.\\nNot that the end of the last series was particularly funny, as Barry’s sinister past finally caught up with him. “When season three aired, people were like, ‘Wow, it’s not really a comedy any more,’” says Hader. “And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ And then you go back and watch that last episode of season three, and I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, really funny.’” He’s being sarcastic, of course. As with Breaking Bad, a drama to which Hader says his show is indebted, Barry is very comfortable plumbing the depths of humanity. Abusive relationships, PTSD, mass murder: the series tackles it all, with an unnerving smile creeping out from the corner of its mouth. “I find if there’s a drama that doesn’t have some humour in it, or if there’s a comedy that doesn’t have some sort of real representation of human emotion or something,” he says, “it usually doesn’t work.”\\nAn exception, he adds, is The Naked Gun, which “doesn’t need any pathos – it’s just really funny”. He showed the 1988 film, which stars Leslie Nielsen as a bungling detective, to his three daughters during the pandemic. “I was laughing so hard,” says Hader, for whom watching comedy has always been a family affair. Indeed, growing up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of a dance teacher and the owner of an air cargo company, Hader became obsessed with the surrealist farce of Monty Python. “My dad was a massive fan,” he says. “A ton of stuff from Monty Python’s Flying Circus didn’t make sense to me coming from Tulsa.” Although he didn’t fully understand the characters – such as John Cleese’s BBC continuity announcer, with his catchphrase “And now for something completely different” – it didn’t matter. “It only added to the excitement,” Hader says. “There was something very exotic about it to me.”\\nHowever much he loved Monty Python, though, it was filmmaking, rather than comedy, that initially drove the young Bill Hader. Long before he was one of the most ubiquitous comic actors of his generation, popping up in everything from Knocked Up to Trainwreck, Adventureland to Inside Out, he had designs on directing movies like those of Scorsese, Terrence Malick and Andrzej Wajda. After attending New York Film Academy in 1996, he spent a few unproductive semesters at the Art Institute of Phoenix and Scottsdale Community College, then dropped out and moved to LA in 1999. Starting at the bottom, he would persevere behind the scenes, directing a short film here, writing a screenplay there, but mostly working as a production assistant on movie sets. Acting was never something he truly considered, until a bad break-up prompted him to start taking classes at Second City LA, a school that specialised in improvisation and sketch comedy. He was good.\\nSoon enough, while performing backyard sketch shows in Van Nuys with a group of friends, one of whom was the brother of Nick Offerman from Parks and Recreation, Hader caught the attention of Megan Mullally. The Will & Grace star – and Offerman’s wife since 2003 – was so transfixed by Hader that she recommended him to SNL creator Lorne Michaels. Hader, who was working as an assistant editor on a cookery show at the time, nailed the audition, which required three original characters and three impersonations. An eight-year stint on SNL followed, ending in 2013.\\nIf Hader lacked experience, it certainly didn’t show. During his time there, his uncanny celebrity improvisations – from Al Pacino to James Mason – became the fulcrum around which the series revolved. Think of all those characters he developed. The elderly, misanthropic news correspondent Herb Welch. The slack-jawed Californian gardener Devin. The indelibly gaudy nightclub guide Stefon. Last year, Hader explained that SNL had “floated” the idea that he come back to play Stefon – a gay character – but he’d turned it down because of the political climate.\\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 day\\nNew subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

So [those attitudes] are really prevalent.” He went on to say how the idea that people saw the character differently to him had been eye-opening, “because I really love Stefon and it never occurred to me that he would be seen as a stereotype, and that really hurt”.\\nSince then, though, he’s changed his mind. “Honestly, I don’t know why I said that,” he tells me. “I probably would play him. I think just being asked the question at that point in time kind of made me anxious.” In fact, gay men approached him to express dismay at his comments. “I’ve never had any gay man come up to me and be offended that I [played Stefon].” The opposite, he says, mentioning that he also played a gay man in the 2014 film The Skeleton Twins. “I’ve always had people come up and say how much they love those roles.”\\nOf all the oddballs Hader portrayed on SNL, only one of them would he put out to pasture: Vinny Vedecci, the loud, unprofessional talk-show host who ticks just about every box on the Italian cliché list. “An Italian woman told me she was offended by it, and I was like, ‘All I’m trying to do is the old comic staple, you know, gibberish and everything.’ And she was like, ‘Right, but my father spoke like that and he actually spoke Italian.’ Your sensibility changes when you get older,” he says. “I don’t think I would do that again.”\\nConversation turns to outrage culture. “I sympathise with and understand the sensitivity,” says Hader of the current mood. “But as someone who creates things, I think you want to be able to create things in a genuine way and in an honest way. And what’s happened, especially on social media, is that there are people who aren’t funny, or content that is just offensive,” he says. Meanwhile, other people are making “very interesting stuff that is art. I think the lines have been blurred.”\\nI bring up Superbad, the ribald, well-received 2007 comedy in which Hader played a cop. In recent years the film has come under greater scrutiny, its boorish teenage sexism and relentless catering to the male gaze leading to a view – in some quarters – that it’s a deeply problematic coming-of-age story. Indeed, an article in the Chicago Tribune in 2018, headlined “How teen comedies like Superbad normalise sexual assault”, dissected a premise that, crudely speaking, is about two horny boys using alcohol to try to dupe women into having sex with them. Add in jokes about menstrual blood and sexual preference, and you can perhaps see why the film has been re-evaluated.\\nDoes Hader think the film in any way condoned the boys’ attitudes? “I haven’t seen that movie in a very long time,” he says. “I’ve heard rumblings, but I’m not on social media, so I don’t really have my finger on the pulse right now. You know, those kids are idiots, like we were all idiots. The point,” he continues, “is that they’re losers and they’re looking for girls and beer and, I mean, that story’s been there for ever. But then, in actuality, the two boys are just in love with each other. That end scene is so funny.”\\nIf “bawdy yet poignant” sums up a lot of Hader’s early films, Barry really is a different beast, a drolly sophisticated series that mixes bathos with brutality. Light relief comes from Henry Winkler’s gregarious drama teacher Gene M Cousineau. I ask Hader if Winkler really is as sweet as they say. “The hardest thing with Henry is that getting him to play an a**hole is very hard,” says Hader, giggling. “Most of my direction to him, genuinely, is to say, ‘Don’t smile. There’s brightness in your eye.’ So, yeah, he is, and he brings a very good cake to the set.” What kind? “Usually a chocolate bundt cake. He gave me the whole history of where the cake came from and what the recipe is. And he really does eat like an 18-year-old. I don’t know how he eats the way he eats. I put on 25lb these past two seasons just from stress and not taking care of myself, and I still don’t eat the way he eats, and he looks great.” He giggles again. “Like, I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.”\\nDoes he struggle with body image? “You know, you have to watch yourself on screen,” says Hader. “And that’s no fun, just in general. I don’t like the way I sound. I don’t like the way I look. It’s just embarrassing. But I’ll be 45 in two months, so the weight thing is more of a health thing now. You go to a doctor and they say, ‘At this age and height, you should weigh this.’” When he was performing on SNL, it was more about vanity, he explains. “I wasn’t used to seeing myself on screen – you go, ‘God I look terrible,’ so you start exercising and jogging and stuff. I still ate like s***, though. Now I have this autoimmune condition, too. I’m just at that age.”\\nBeing hard on the writing is a very important part of the process\\nTalking to Hader, you get the sense his brain is a traffic jam of worries. Over the past few years, he’s talked extensively about the anxiety and panic attacks he suffered while on SNL. Neither the critical acclaim nor the awards have helped. “I got that review, and I was like, ‘You know what? My anxiety went away.’ I got an award and walked off stage, and went, ‘Wow. I’m not on fire any more.’” His voice is dripping with sarcasm again. “No, I do have very bad stage fright, and I do get very, very anxious before I have to go in front of a group of people.”\\nHis capacity for self-criticism, he says, can be a double-edged sword. “You should be hard on the work,” he notes. “It’s very good to write it and get all the emotions out, all the feelings, the story, the big, inspired version of it, and then it’s very good to put it away. Because you think, when it’s finished, that you’re a genius. You got to wait for a little bit, a couple of weeks, or a month – you bring it back out and you go, ‘Who the f*** wrote this, this is terrible.’ And that’s a very important part of the process, you know, to be hard on the material.\\n“But then,” he continues, “there’s also a thing that I just have naturally, which is a big self-criticism that can be disruptive in your personal life, that is being hard on yourself, and doesn’t really yield any results. It’s just a cycle of self-criticism that doesn’t yield anything.”\\nWhile Hader is candid about his anxiety, he’s less so about his private life. Before our conversation, I posted on my Instagram that I was interviewing him. I was suddenly inundated with messages from friends declaring their love for him, and pleading that I pass on their phone number. I tell him. “If they saw me at home,” he says, squirming hilariously in his chair, “all that would fly out the window, but that’s very sweet. Tell them thank you.” Though he insists he’s not aware of his sex symbol status, the internet is awash with stories about Hader, with his ex, The OC actor Rachel Bilson, particularly complimentary about him, calling their break-up in 2020 “harder than childbirth”. After their split, Hader dated Anna Kendrick for a year or so; his new girlfriend is Ali Wong, star of Netflix’s existential new thriller Beef.\\nHader declines to discuss his dating life, so I change the subject. Let’s talk about Star Wars, I suggest. Along with Ben Schwartz, Hader is credited as a “vocal consultant” for BB-8, the cute little droid that first appeared in The Force Awakens. He’s happy to oblige in geeking out on the topic.\\n“My kids love Star Wars and I was so into it when I was young.” He remembers playing with a toy Millennium Falcon in the early Eighties. “I was flying it around my house,” he recalls. “I caught the edge of a wall and it bounced back and hit me in the face. It knocked a tooth out!”\\nSpeaking about his childhood jolts him into thoughts of his own young family – he had his three daughters with his ex-wife, director Maggie Carey – and how his next move is to spend more time with them. “My girlfriend and I realised that I haven’t had a vacation in 10 years,” he says. “So she and I might do something to reintroduce myself to my kids.”\\nAfter all, the Star Wars movie didn’t exactly do that job for him. Hader admits that, in the end, he was barely in it.\\n“I mean, that’s the weird thing. It was just JJ Abrams being a nice guy. It was like something you would do for someone who won a contest,” he says, grinning. “But it’s pretty cool seeing your name in blue at the end.”\\nSeason four of ‘Barry’ is available Mondays on Sky Comedy and streaming service Now\\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in\"}\n",

Our work is project-based, so I have the opportunity to hire a new cohort about twice a year.\\nI have these big ideals about how the job interview is an incredible opportunity to get to know candidates from nontraditional backgrounds, to work with the candidate to determine how their skills could translate to a position on my team. But I cannot conduct a consistent interview for the life of me. I plan out my spiel and my questions — then dive off-script at the first awkward pause, overcome by the urge to tell the candidate I know exactly what they mean, and I have the quips and anecdotes to prove it. I feel like I’m hosting a talk show, not a hiring process. This leads to some delightful 30-minute conversations, and some stilted 10-minute chats where I fear the candidate and I both think I’m wasting their time. I’m sure a more standard, professional interview would be more fair, reduce bias and establish me as a trustworthy authority figure.\\nHow do I hold better interviews?

Research underscores the correlation between regular high-intensity interval training and increased cardiovascular fitness.\\nStrength and flexibility: Practising kicks, punches, and grappling manoeuvres during sparring helps build muscular strength and flexibility. Practitioners find themselves more agile and capable of executing complicated techniques effortlessly.\\nCoordination and reflexes: Sparring rapidly enhances hand-eye coordination and reflex response times. Since opponents’ movements are unpredictable, martial artists learn to react swiftly and accurately, translating these improved responses into everyday life scenarios.\\nAside from physical benefits, sparring significantly contributes to one’s mental and emotional development. It helps in cultivating attributes such as resilience, focus, and emotional regulation.\\nFacing challenges: Sparring presents various challenges, including dealing with an opponent’s unpredictable approach and facing up to one’s limitations. By confronting these obstacles, martial artists build resilience and perseverance, essential life skills that transcend beyond the dojo.\\nCoping with failure: It’s common to experience setbacks in sparring, whether it’s getting hit or being outmanoeuvred. Learning to cope with these small failures instils a growth mindset, where setbacks are seen as opportunities for improvement rather than defeat.\\nImmediate feedback: Unlike solo training or forms/katas, sparring provides instant feedback on performance. Martial artists need to analyse opponent moves in real-time and adjust their strategies accordingly, which hones focus and decision-making under pressure.\\nMindfulness in action: Sparring demands complete presence of mind. Practitioners must stay in the moment, monitoring their breathing, movements, and the opponent’s actions. This practice significantly sharpens concentration and promotes mental clarity.\\nEach martial arts discipline employs unique sparring techniques tailored to its distinct fighting styles and principles. Let’s explore how sparring operates within a few popular forms of martial arts.\\nControlled contact: Unlike full-contact sparring in other martial arts, Karate sparring (Kumite) generally emphasises control. Points are awarded for well-executed techniques that stop just short of making full contact, teaching practitioners precision and control.\\nZanshin: A key concept in Karate is Zanshin, referring to a state of heightened awareness and readiness. Sparring in Karate sharpens this mental state, encouraging practitioners to be ever-vigilant and prepared for any attack, even outside the dojo.\\nGround combat: BJJ sparring, or rolling, focuses heavily on ground fighting techniques. Practitioners learn to apply and transition between various holds, locks, and chokes, cultivating superior grappling skills.\\nStrategic planning: Rolling demands a deep understanding of strategy. Success typically hinges on recognising and capitalising on the opponent’s weaknesses, encouraging a focus on tactical thinking and planning.\\nSpeed and agility: With its emphasis on high, fast kicks and dynamic movements, Taekwondo sparring helps develop rapid reflexes and exceptional agility. Practitioners frequently practice evading and counter-attacking in swift succession.\\nOlympic focus: Given its status as an Olympic sport, Taekwondo sparring adopts specific rules designed for safety and fairness, including protective gear and point systems favouring clean, controlled kicks to the torso and head.\\nSafety in sparring cannot be overstressed. Proper equipment and adherence to safety protocols are paramount to prevent injuries and maintain a respectful training environment.\\nHeadgear and mouthguards: Headgear and mouthguards are essential for protecting the head and oral cavity from direct impact, significantly reducing the risk of concussions and dental injuries.\\nGloves and shin guards: Boxing gloves or specific martial arts gloves protect the hands while delivering punches, while shin guards shield the lower legs from strikes, particularly in styles like Muay Thai and Taekwondo.\\nGroin and chest protectors: Groin protectors are crucial for male practitioners to prevent severe injuries. Chest protectors, commonly used in Taekwondo, provide an added layer of protection against high-impact blows.\\nControlled techniques: Practitioners must be trained to pull their punches and kicks to avoid causing unnecessary harm. Emphasis on controlled techniques ensures both participants can spar safely.\\nRespect: Mutual respect is embedded in all martial arts practices. Bowing before and after sparring, following the instructor’s commands, and maintaining courteous behaviour are fundamental to a positive sparring experience.\\nThere are numerous misconceptions surrounding sparring, often deterring individuals from participating. Addressing these myths can encourage more practitioners to embrace this integral aspect of martial arts training.\\nMany believe sparring is reserved for advanced martial artists. In reality, sparring can be adapted to suit all skill levels, offering beginners a controlled environment to apply techniques learned in practice.\\nWhile sparring entails physical contact, it doesn’t necessarily lead to injury. Adhering to proper safety measures and using the necessary protective gear can mitigate most risks, ensuring a safe and productive sparring session.\\nSparring is often mistakenly viewed as a competition. However, the primary focus is on learning and improvement, not winning or losing. Practitioners spar to grow, refine techniques, and prepare for actual confrontations.\\nMany apprehend sparring as an aggressive and intimidating experience. With the right guidance and respect for both partners, sparring transforms into a constructive and mutually beneficial activity fostering camaraderie and growth.\\nSparring is beneficial for all genders. Women can benefit greatly from sparring, enhancing their self-defence skills, physical conditioning, and confidence. Encouraging inclusivity in sparring enriches the martial arts community.\\nSponsored Ad\\nYes, beginners can and should participate in sparring once they have learned fundamental techniques and understand basic safety measures. It’s an excellent applied learning experience.\\nSparring frequency varies depending on individual goals and training plans. Generally, sparring once a week can yield noticeable improvements in physical conditioning and technique application.\\nFocus on applying learned techniques, maintaining proper form, and keeping a calm mind. Avoid focusing on “winning” and instead aim for learning and improvement.\\nUtilise all recommended protective gear, adhere strictly to the dojo’s safety rules, practise control over your techniques, and spar under the supervision of an experienced instructor.\\nYes, sparring is beneficial for children as it helps develop physical fitness, discipline, self-confidence, and social skills. Ensure that sessions are appropriately supervised and adapted to be age-appropriate.\\nSparring holds a pivotal role in martial arts training, providing innumerable physical, mental, and emotional benefits to practitioners of all levels. Through structured, respectful, and safety-conscious engagement, sparring offers a unique platform for applying techniques, improving reflexes, and experiencing real-world combat scenarios. Moreover, it fosters essential life skills such as resilience, focus, and strategic thinking, proving invaluable both within and outside the dojo. Dispelling common myths about sparring encourages a more inclusive and open mindset towards this vital practice, paving the way for continued growth and enrichment within the martial arts community. Whether you’re a novice or a seasoned martial artist, embracing sparring is key to truly mastering the art.Online art courses\\nStay safe and perform your best with top-quality martial arts training and protection gear!\\nCopyright 2023 © All rights Reserved.'}\n",

You can do so based on a conversation\\'s direction of communication (a one-way or two-way street) and its tone/purpose (competitive or cooperative).\\nIf you are in a one-way conversation, you are talking at someone, rather than with someone. If you are in a two-way conversation, participants are both listening and talking. In a competitive conversation, people are more concerned about their own perspective, whereas in a cooperative conversation participants are interested in the perspective of everyone involved.\\nBased on direction and tone, I grouped conversations into four types: debate, dialogue, discourse, and diatribe.\\nTo highlight the differences between these types of conversations, let’s use politics as an example:\\nIt is important to know which type of conversation you are in, because that determines the purpose of that conversation. If you can identify the purpose, you can better speak to the heart of that conversation. But, if you misidentify the conversation you are in, you can fall into conversational pitfalls.\\nHere are a few examples of conversational pitfalls I’ve written about:\\nIf someone appears to be in a conversational pitfall, you can help them climb back out.\\xa0Regardless of how one climbs back out, the solution always starts with identifying which hole you are in. You must first know the problem before you can find the solution. And, sometimes, just identifying the pitfall itself is enough to draw attention to the problem and correct the conversation.\\nWhen you are in a conversation, take a moment to think about which conversation you are actually in. Each of the types of conversation are meaningless on their own; you give them meaning in their use. And, ultimately, it is up to you to decide what type of conversation you want to be part of.\\nWhile this article is a discourse (I\\'ve been writing, you\\'ve been reading) it doesn\\'t have to remain that way.

Learning how to continue dialogue in a script is important for the screenwriter to understand. Particularly from a formatting perspective. But it’s also important for both the cast and crew to recognize as the continued dialogue. Especially if it’s formatting incorrectly, could change the dynamics of the entire scene.\\nSo how do you not only apply the continuation of dialogue within a script. But also how is the dialogue formatted so that cast, and crew, know what to expect?\\nWriting dialogue for any script can be challenging. Regardless of whether it’s for a short film script or a full length feature.\\nWhen nuances like simple punctuation and formatting get in the way. Mastering something like the continuation of dialogue in a script really can be confusing at best.\\nFirst, you need to make sure that you’re taking the appropriate steps to format dialogue in your script. Regardless of whether the dialogue is short, long, continuous or not.\\nTo start, begin by structuring your dialogue in a way in which it is very clear that the next words in your script are actually dialogue.\\nAnd they cannot be confused with things like sluglines, headings, or other script elements.\\nYou might be wondering when it’s okay to include the term “continued” in a script, particularly as it may apply to learning how to continue dialogue in a script.\\nThe word “continued” should be used to signify the ongoing dialogue of a character when it extends beyond a single page of script.\\nSuch that the dialogue spans from the bottom of one page and begins again at the top of the next.\\nScreenwriting software is generally going to format this for you such that the dialogue will end on one page with (MORE) and on the next page.\\nYou’ll see the character’s name followed by (CONT’D). While it’s okay to adjust this, it’s really not necessary and, since consistency is key in formatting, it’s best that you leave it alone.\\nWhen there’s a single speaker but the dialogue spans multiple paragraphs you can generally open with quotation marks and begin your dialogue.\\nAt the end of a paragraph, there is no need to use quotation marks if you will have another paragraph of dialogue immediately following.\\nYou can end the first paragraph with standard terminal punctuation such as a period, question mark, or an exclamation point depending on the style of sentence preceding the punctuation.\\nUse quotation marks at the start of the opening sentence in the next paragraph. When the last sentence of the dialogue has been established, it should have its ending punctuation.\\nAs well as the final set of quotation marks to close the dialogue out. No matter how many paragraphs you have, the preceding paragraphs do not contain ending quotation marks.\\nBut they all have beginning quotation marks and the final paragraph ends with a quotation mark too.\\nThe term “pre-lap” is used to describe dialogue that the audience will hear from a previous scene as the next scene’s visuals begin to transition onto the screen.\\nLearning how to continue dialogue in a script that is essentially playing from the prior scene as the new visuals begin for the upcoming scene requires some basic adjustments to the slugline.\\nTo help the reader know what the audience should be hearing in relation to the prior scene as the next scene begins, use the term “Pre Lap” next to the character’s name.\\nDREW (PRE-LAP)\\nI couldn’t find my wallet when I left the house, but I should still be able to get in.\\nINT. MOVIE THEATER – DAY\\nDrew turns to his partner to pay for popcorn.\\nDREW (CONT’D)\\nThanks a lot, I’ll pay you back later.\\nAs you can see, learning how to continue dialogue in a script can take on a variety of potential circumstances. Depending on exactly how the dialogue is being delivered.\\nAnd the continuation whether it’s into another scene, from a prior scene, or just onto another page of the script.\\nFormatting dialogue is essential to allow the reader maximum understanding of what’s taking place within the script and who’s speaking.\\nKeeping it as simple, fluent, and consistent as possible is key.\\n-Your Budget Range -\\nNot Sure\\n$1 - $5k\\n$5k - $10k\\n$10k - $30k\\n$30k - $50k\\n$50k - $100k\\n$100k - $500k\\n$1M+\\nCopyright ©2025 BeverlyBoy by Lifespikes.

Here are 20 effective ways to let someone know you need to have a conversation, along with practical examples to guide you in various situations.\\nStarting with \"Can we have a conversation?\" is a polite and straightforward way to express your need to talk. This phrase sets a calm tone and invites open dialogue without causing discomfort.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"Can we have a conversation? There’s something on my mind that I’d like to discuss.\"\\nOther Person: \"Sure, I’m available now. What’s up?\"\\nThis phrase is direct and assertive, indicating that there’s a specific matter needing attention. It suggests urgency and importance, making it clear that the topic at hand is significant.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"You and I should talk about this issue. It’s about the recent changes in our project timeline.\"\\nOther Person: \"Alright, let’s set up a time to go over it.\"\\nAsking \"Is this a good time to talk?\" shows respect for the other person’s schedule. It acknowledges their availability and ensures that you’re choosing an appropriate moment for the conversation.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"Hey, Sarah, is this a good time to talk? I have something important to discuss with you.\"\\nSarah: \"Yes, I have a few minutes now. What’s on your mind?\"\\nThis approach is gentle yet effective, signaling that you have something important to talk about. It opens the door to a meaningful conversation while giving the other person a chance to prepare.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"There’s something on my mind that I’d like to share. I’ve noticed some changes in our team dynamics, and I think we need to address them.\"\\nOther Person: \"I see, let’s find a time to talk about it.\"\\nUsing this phrase indicates that you’ve considered the issue deeply and are ready to discuss it.

There’s an important matter regarding our budget that we need to go over.\"\\nOther Person: \"Sure, let’s sit down and discuss it.\"\\nThis phrase conveys a sense of urgency and seriousness, indicating that the matter at hand is significant and needs to be addressed promptly.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"I believe it’s time we had a serious discussion about our upcoming project deadlines. We need to align our efforts.\"\\nOther Person: \"Agreed, let’s schedule a meeting to tackle this.\"\\nBy requesting someone’s attention, you subtly signal that you have something important to discuss. This approach is straightforward and sets the stage for a focused conversation.\\nExample:\\nYou: \"I need your attention for a moment. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with my current workload and need to talk about it.\"\\nOther Person: \"Okay, let’s talk about it now.\"\\nThis phrase highlights the significance of the topic and prepares the other person for a serious discussion.

Extemporaneous speaking is not delivering a monologue or a memorized speech. Public speaking students often fall into the trap of under-preparing and under-practicing their speeches. This results in an, “Oh! no! I am not prepared and now I must read this outline word-for-word and hope for the best.” However, the best does not come to fruition and students that engage in this practice are disappointed when they lose substantial points from their speech grade due to lack of preparation, practice, and reading word-for-word from an outline. Just – don’t – do -it.\\nHere are a few ways you can engage in extemporaneous speaking:\\nThe first tenet of the dialogic perspective is that communication should be a dialogue and not a monologue. Lev Yakubinsky argued that even public speaking situations often turn into dialogues when audience members actively engage speakers by asking questions. He even claimed that nonverbal behavior (e.g., nodding one’s head in agreement or scowling) functions as feedback for speakers and contributes to a dialogue (Yakubinsky, 1997). Overall, if you approach your public speaking experience as a dialogue, you’ll be more actively engaged as a speaker and more attentive to how your audience is responding, which will, in turn, lead to more actively engaged audience members.\\nAs you progress through this course, you will revisit proper extemporaneous speaking, the use of outlining, proper use of notecards, and delivering a strong speech. It is important to note that your audience deserves a speech that is interesting, thoughtful, and well-rehearsed. The audience is listening to you as the credible speaker in the room; in order to remain credible and professional, you will want to deliver an extemporaneous speech.\\nKey Takeaways\\nStudents will want to become familiar with extemporaneous speaking in order to work towards a speech delivery that relies on effective speech strategies and not reading word-for-word from an outline.\\nPrevious/next navigation\\nPublic Speaking Copyright © by Dr. Layne Goodman; Various; and Amber Acosta, PhD is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, except where otherwise noted.\\nPowered by Pressbooks\"}\n",

Apparently, Clarke had been nursing a serious hangover when his attempt to do a stunt flip went awry, and he landed on his head. Luckily, he wasn’t injured and nailed the stunt on another take.\\nRick had not originally wanted to create a music video for this song, but he was eventually forced to by the director.\\nOnce the internet revived the song’s popularity, some realized Robo’s theme from the Super Nintendo game Chrono Trigger bore a striking resemblance to “Never Gonna GIve You Up”. It was a coincidence, as the game’s composer had never heard Rick Astley’s song. Still, mash-ups of both are common. The 1987 video was officially uploaded to YouTube on the 24th of October 2009 and has over one billion views as of 2021. Never Gonna Give You Up sheet music is also available for free.\\nFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaning\\n4chan had a prank where links advertising for something instead linked to a picture of Duckroll (itself inspired by a word replacer that changed “egg” to “duck”, hence “eggroll” = “duckroll”). Then in 2007, as the Grand Theft Auto IV trailer was unavailable due to heavy traffic, someone on /v/ posted a link that actually led to “Never Gonna Give You Up” – evolving the “Duckroll” into the “Rickroll”.
