But then it took a turn: The moderators asked Mr. Castro whether accepting such assistance would be any different from Democrats\u2019 seizing on the so-called Steele dossier, which was written by a former British spy and funded by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, and which alleged ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\nMr. Castro brought his answer back to Mr. Trump, though, delivering the most memorable quote of the evening: \u201cWhat in the hell is wrong with that president?\u201d\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nSydney Ember is a political reporter based in New York.

Appleman/Democracy in Action. All rights reserved.\n\n### Juli\u00e1n Castro officially announces 2020 presidential bid\nFormer secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro officially announced his presidential bid in San Antonio on Saturday, beginning a campaign that will look to turn his uniquely American immigrant story into a direct repudiation of President Donald Trump.\n\u201cWhen my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I\u2019m sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for President of the United States of America,\u201d Castro said.\nRELATED VIDEO\nJulian Castro announces 2020 presidential run\nCastro, the former mayor of San Antonio, had been considering a bid for nearly two years and announced a presidential exploratory committee in December. He has long been viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party since he first landed on the national scene by delivering the keynote speech for President Barack Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\nCastro, in an interview with CNN ahead of his official presidential announcement, acknowledged that he will enter the race looking up at the cadre of other Democrats considering running for the party\u2019s nomination.\nBut Castro, whose grandmother, Victoria Castro, was born in the Mexican border state of Coahuila, and crossed into the United States at Eagle Pass, Texas, in 1922 after her parents died during the Mexican Revolution, added that at no time in his life, from growing up on San Antonio\u2019s impoverished West Side to his run for mayor in 2009, was he considered the favorite to get ahead.\n\u201cI am not a frontrunner in this race, but I have not been a frontrunner at any time in my life,\u201d Castro said, adding that people who grew up in the neighborhoods he grew up in were never considered frontrunners. \u201cI am going to go speak to them in a way that resonates with them.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cMy family\u2019s story is a testament to what is possible when this country gets it right.\u201d\nCastro\u2019s personal story, along with that of his twin brother, Joaquin, has been central to his rise on the national stage and made up the bulk of his 2012 convention speech.\nCastro\u2019s brother - who also serves as a member of Congress - will serve as his campaign chairman, according to a campaign press release provided to CNN.\nCastro was raised primarily by his grandmother \u2013 who he called Mamo \u2013 and Rosie Castro, his Chicana political activist mother, eventually excelling enough to attend Stanford University and, eventually, Harvard Law School. He returned home and served as a member of the San Antonio City Council and, from 2009 until 2014, the mayor of the city. Obama picked him to be housing secretary in 2014.\nRELATED ARTICLE\nJulian Castro moves closer to 2020 presidential run with exploratory committee\nThe former mayor was among a handful of contenders to be Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick in 2016. Although he was eventually passed over for Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Castro said Clinton\u2019s loss and Trump\u2019s victory was the moment he began considering a run.\n\u201cDonald Trump represents the opposite of what I am and what I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many Americans, a lot changed when Donald Trump got into office. And that is what has compelled me to think about running.\u201d\nCastro slammed Trump throughout his announcement speech, particularly some of the language he uses to describe immigrants and his plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\u201cWe say no to building a wall and say yes to building community. We say no to scapegoating immigrants, and yes to Dreamers, yes to keeping families together, and yes to finally passing comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Castro said to applause.\nCastro, in an interview with CNN after his announcement, dismissed the suggestion that former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke running for the Democratic nomination against him would damage his chances, but he did admit that he wishes the popular Democrat would stay on the sidelines.\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019d rather be the only Democrat running from Texas,\u201d Castro said. \u201cBut I think that we are going to have a crowded primary, we don\u2019t know who is going to run and so everybody is going to have to go and put out their vision and do the hard work of campaigning and reaching voters.\u201d\nCastro called himself the \u201cantidote to Trump\u201d because \u201cmy story is am immigrant story, is a testament to what immigrants have contributed to this country.\u201d\nCastro\u2019s entrance makes him the only declared Latino in the Democratic field, a relatively powerful position given how the party has leaned on Latino voters and turnout efforts to tilt states like Nevada, Arizona and Texas their direction in recent years.\nBut Castro told CNN that he believes he can perform well in Iowa and is backing that confidence up, according to a source with knowledge of Castro\u2019s operation, by naming Derek Eadon, the former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, to a senior role on his nascent campaign.\nMaya Rupert, formerly the executive director of Castro\u2019s PAC, will serve as campaign manager and Derek Eadon, formerly the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, will be Castro\u2019s deputy campaign manager.\nCastro and his team have signaled in the lead up to Saturday\u2019s announcement that he will lean into his Mexican-American heritage in a presidential run. When the former mayor filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, he had to hand write in an accent over \u201ca\u201d in Juli\u00e1n, a fact that Castro and his team have held up as proof that he is already changing the system.\nEvidence of this strategy peppered the plaza on San Antonio\u2019s West Side where Castro announced on Saturday: A mariachi band welcomed guests, as taco trucks fed people outside. The venue was blocks from Castro\u2019s childhood home and across the street from where he was baptized. Even Castro\u2019s logo - which emphasizes the accent over the \u201ca\u201d in Julian - highlights the former mayor\u2019s heritage.\nThe audience in San Antonio was filled with people who knew Castro from his youth, and people who were impacted by his time in elected office.\nAlma Palacios, a Mexican immigrant, decided to name her son Juli\u00e1n after the city\u2019s former mayor and now presidential candidate. And the younger Juli\u00e1n, sporting a full Spider-Man outfit, watched as Castro announced his bid.\n\u201cHis is an inspiration and a good role model to all of us Hispanics,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cIt means a lot (to see him announce).\u201d\nCastro does not speak fluent Spanish, writing in his 2018 memoir that his mother spoke English at home, like many immigrants at the time, and that he declined to take Spanish classes in school because he spoke it with his grandmother.\n\u201cI\u2019ve resolved that before I die, I want to speak it fluently,\u201d said Castro, who has used the program Rosetta Stone to learn the language.\nCastro delivered the crescendo of his speech in Spanish and closed with a similar call to action.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s get to work,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cVamonos!\u201d\nCastro will travel to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for a campaign event on Monday, before heading to New Hampshire on Tuesday.\nCastro said ahead of his run that he hopes to provide a \u201cpositive example\u201d to young Latinos with his run but won\u2019t solely focus on courting voters in heavily Latino states and shirk visiting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\u201cI am just going to be myself,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus will be about representing everybody but of course there is a special significance to the Latino community especially because many Latinos feels like there is a target on their back from this administration.\u201d\nHis announcement speech also previewed a candidacy that will focus on good government, education and climate change, an issue Castro called \u201cthe biggest threat to our prosperity in the 21st century.\u201d\nThe Republican National Committee slammed Castro\u2019s announcement, calling him \u201canother delusional Democrat.\u201d\nCastro was reflective days before his announcement, acknowledging how his wife\u2019s support and mother\u2019s political work helped him get to this point. If he had a disappointment, he said, it was that is grandmother, who died when he was younger, could not be there to see him.\n\u201cI wish my grandmother could be with us to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cWin or lose, I hope that I will have a chance to inspire a lot of young kids out there to reach for their dreams.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nAs President Trump and various politicians pushed unfounded claims about voter fraud during a mandatory recount of Florida's U.S. Senate election results in November 2018, an army of internet trolls started spreading the rumor that 53,000 dead people turned up on the state's voter rolls:\nOne of the most popular tweets pushing this rumor issued from the account \"Red Nation Rising\" and insinuated some of the dead people had \"voted\" in the election. The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.\nLopez, German. \u00a0 \"The Florida Voter Fraud Allegations, Explained.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 12 November 2018.\nFineout, Gary. \u00a0 \"2012 Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 WTVJ. \u00a0 11 May 2012.\nAllen, Greg. \u00a0 \"World War II Vet Caught Up in Florida's Voter Purge Controversy.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 NPR. \u00a0 31 May 2012.\nFox News. \u00a0 \"53K Dead People on Florida's Voter Rolls.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 17 May 2012.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Debunking Viral Claims Archives - FactCheck.org\nThese articles debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Mike Lee of Utah and others posted unfounded claims on social media about the political affiliation of the gunman arrested in the June 14 fatal shootings of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the wounding of another Democratic state lawmaker and his wife.\nQ: Is there an ad in Craigslist to hire people to riot in L.A.?\nA: No, there has been no such ad on Craigslist. Some social media posts cited a Craigslist ad to falsely claim it showed that people protesting the immigration raids in Los Angeles were being paid for their actions. But a pair of podcasters told the Associated Press they placed the ad as a prank for their show, and it had nothing to do with the protests.\nQ: Did President Donald Trump call military nurse Ruby Bradley a \u201closer,\u201d and were there orders for her service history to be removed from Department of Defense archives?\nA: There\u2019s no evidence for these claims. We could find no record of Trump referring to nurse Ruby Bradley, who received 34 medals for her service during World War II and the Korean War. A Pentagon spokesperson told us that there was \u201cnothing deleted and/or taken offline related to Ruby Bradley\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said in a March 30 interview that \u201cthere are methods\u201d for him to serve a third term in the White House, and a Daily Mail article referred to a \u201cloophole\u201d in the 22nd Amendment that would make it possible. But legal experts told us the \u201cloophole\u201d legal argument is \u201cimplausible\u201d and \u201cdefeats the clear intent\u201d of the amendment.\nVice President JD Vance has said White House adviser Elon Musk has made \u201cmistakes\u201d in his work with the Department of Government Efficiency. But social media posts are sharing what experts said is a manipulated audio clip that purports to be Vance making much harsher remarks about Musk. The vice president\u2019s spokesperson called the clip \u201c100% fake.\u201d\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump expressed admiration for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s deadly war on drug suspects. But social media posts have falsely claimed that Trump has ordered Duterte\u2019s release from the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity. We could find no response from Trump regarding Duterte\u2019s arrest.\nThe Department of Agriculture announced the cancellation of a $600,000 grant to study the development of feminine hygiene products made of natural fibers. The USDA, Department of Government Efficiency and social media posts misleadingly claimed the study was of \u201cmenstrual cycles in transgender men.\u201d The university behind the study said it was focused on making safer products to \u201cbenefit all biological women.\u201d\nSocial media posts, some pointing to comments by podcaster Joe Rogan, are spreading unsupported claims that members of the Patriot Front are federal agents and that the group disbanded after the recent leadership change at the FBI. But days after Kash Patel was confirmed as FBI director, the Patriot Front had two public rallies, and its website refutes the claims.\nElon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have been tasked by President Donald Trump with slashing federal spending. But social media posts falsely claim that as part of that effort, DOGE stopped \u201croyalties\u201d to former President Barack Obama related to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The claim came from a satirical website.\nA fake audio clip of Donald Trump Jr. saying that the U.S. should have sent weapons to Russia instead of Ukraine was shared across social media. Deepfake experts said the audio was apparently generated using artificial intelligence. A spokesperson for Trump Jr. said the audio clip is \u201c100% fake.\u201d\nQ: Is it true that if President Donald Trump hadn\u2019t defunded the National Weather Service, the death toll in the Texas flooding would have been far lower or nonexistent?\nA: The Trump administration did not defund the NWS but did reduce the staff by 600 people. Those staffing cuts did not cause the high number of deaths in the flash floods on July 4, experts said. Local forecasting offices were sufficiently staffed and issued timely warnings. But experts raised concerns about key positions being vacant, which could have affected coordination with local communities.\n\n### Evaluating the effect of viral posts on social media engagement\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Nonetheless, there has been little consideration of whether these viral events genuinely boost the attention received by the source. To address this gap, we analyze content timelines from over 1000 European news outlets from 2018 to 2023 on Facebook and YouTube, employing a Bayesian structural time series model to evaluate the impact of viral posts. Our results show that most viral events do not significantly increase engagement and rarely lead to sustained growth. We identify two primary types of viral effects corresponding to different mechanisms of collective attention response. A \u2018loaded-type\u2019 virality manifests after a sustained growth phase, representing its final burst, followed by a decline in attention. A \u2018sudden-type\u2019 virality, with news emerging unexpectedly, reactivates the collective response process. Moreover, quick viral effects fade faster, while slower processes lead to more persistent growth. These findings highlight the transient nature of viral events and underscore the importance of consistent, steady attention-building strategies to establish a solid connection with the user base rather than relying on sudden visibility spikes.\nThe advent and proliferation of social media have fundamentally altered the information landscape1,2. As these platforms have become integrated into our daily lives, transforming into essential tools for information diffusion3,4 and personal communication5, they have merged entertainment-driven business models with complex social dynamics6, raising significant concerns about their potential impact on social dynamics7,8,9,10,11. Offering unprecedented opportunities for content to achieve rapid and widespread attention12,13, social media have become crucial environments for the spread of information and misinformation worldwide14,15, especially during sensitive periods such as global elections16,17.\nThis complex interplay has resulted in an ecosystem in which information overload is the foremost feature18, considerably complicating the search for information while giving rise to the phenomenon of infodemics19,20, such as for the COVID-19 pandemic. To this effect, evidence in the literature highlights how online users are prone to consume information aligning with their existing beliefs21,22,23,24,25 and commonly ignore opposing viewpoints26,27. In this competitive environment, which stands out for such an unprecedented amount of available content, a wide range of content creators\u2014from news organizations to individual influencers28,29\u2014compete for the limited resource that is users\u2019 attention30,31,32,33.\nUnderstanding the attention economy in the digital domain is paramount for navigating this vying information market, whereby the pursuit of virality34, characterized by content\u2019s exceptional reach and engagement, plays a pivotal role in shaping how information sources design their strategies of production and diffusion of content. Though one of the most complex issues is understanding why certain items achieve sudden and widespread dissemination while other similar or higher-quality items remain overlooked35,36,37, there is substantial agreement in the literature about sentiment polarity and emotional resonance being a critical trigger of virality38,39, particularly with negative emotions and extreme or sensitive content40,41,42.\nAs a core feature of this environment, virality naturally presents both opportunities and concerns. The potential to rapidly reach a wider audience is undoubtedly appealing to sources, influencing how the information supply side operates, notably in exploiting the algorithmic peculiarities of each platform. On the other hand, its unpredictability43 and the hurdle of monitoring such a volume of sources and content raise serious concerns about its consequences for society, particularly when referring to viral news and their potential impact on the public discourse.\nAgainst this background, there has been little consideration of whether viral events genuinely boost attention in the short and long term. In today\u2019s online ecosystem, it becomes crucial to understand how collective attention responds to abrupt news diffusion and how sudden spikes of visibility reverberate on the subsequent attention captured by the source. As users\u2019 behavior could exhibit persistent patterns across different platforms, topics, and contexts44, the comparative analysis of diverse social media can isolate unaltered consistencies of human dynamics in the digital ecosystem.\nIn this perspective, this study aims to enhance our comprehension of collective attention through a data-driven approach by exploring the dynamics of virality and its effects on users\u2019 engagement on different social media platforms. By analyzing data from Facebook and YouTube, we examine attention patterns after viral posts to assess how these events influence users\u2019 interactions over time. In this study, we use a comparative interrupted time-series (CITS) design implemented using a Bayesian structural time series model (BSTS)45 to evaluate the impact of viral posts on users\u2019 engagement. In our approach, we apply the BSTS by using increasingly broader time windows to observe the effect of the same viral event from a short-term to a long-term perspective. Based on the BSTS\u2019s results, we conduct our analysis first by examining the magnitude of the impact and then its temporal dynamics to address the following two research questions.\nRQ1: Does virality induce engagement growth?\nOur first research question aims to assess whether and how a viral event leads to increased users\u2019 attention received by the source. After that, our second research question aims to analyze the temporal dynamics of these effects to evaluate if the rapidity at which they occur influences their longevity.\nRQ2: Do the faster-emerging effects persist longer?\nWhile our first research question basically aims to determine the actual impact of virality and its magnitude, the second analysis focuses on the relationship between the speed of manifestation and the longevity of the effects. This approach will help determine whether effects that emerge more quickly tend to persist longer or, conversely, if they vanish more rapidly than slow-emerging ones. This analysis provides concrete insights into how collective attention responds to sudden stress conditions, like viral news, and to determine whether these events genuinely contribute to sustained growth or merely act as transient spotlights.\nWe begin by selecting a list of news outlets from NewsGuard46, an organization known for monitoring news outlet activities internationally, rating more than 35,000 news and information sources across several countries. We select all the reported news outlets from Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. NewsGuard provides several categories of descriptive metadata, including the URLs of these news sources\u2019 social media accounts, if available. For Facebook, after identifying all the news outlets with active accounts listed on NewsGuard, we use their Facebook URLs to gather data via CrowdTangle. This Facebook-owned tool monitors interactions on public content from Facebook pages, groups, and verified profiles47. Using the \u2018Historical Data\u2019 feature in CrowdTangle, we download the complete content history of each page, starting from January 1, 2018. Similarly, for YouTube, after selecting all available accounts, we use the YouTube Data API48 to collect their list of published content. Given the fewer YouTube channels and videos compared to Facebook, we extend the observation period for YouTube to begin on January 1, 2016.\nTable\u00a01 provides an overview of the dataset, detailing the total number of Facebook Pages and YouTube channels used in our analysis for each country, along with their respective number of posts and videos. The longitudinal structure and temporal continuity of these page observations are crucial for evaluating the impact of viral events. Therefore, the resulting dataset is formatted consistently for both platforms, containing chronological information about each posted and accessible item. This naturally excludes any content that may have been removed by users or through platform moderation at the time of download. Note that in what follows, we will refer to both Facebook pages and YouTube channels as (information) sources and to Facebook posts and YouTube videos as either content or posts, specifying the platform in the latter case.\nOn social media platforms, virality represents the propensity of content to achieve rapid diffusion and high interactions levels from users34,43. To quantify virality, we use a bivariate approach based on two measures, spreading and interactions. For reasons of occurrence and availability of variables on the different platforms, we first identify the most appropriate metrics to evaluate the above mentioned measures to adapt them to the availability of variables and platform peculiarities, which generally represent the most challenging aspect of working with different social media.\nFor Facebook data, we adopt the metric provided by49, assessing that the suggested measurement works properly with our data. Originally defined on Twitter data, the proposed metric can be applied to any social media platform with equivalent Retweets and Followers metrics. On Facebook, Shares are equivalent to Retweets, representing the number of users sharing certain content. On both platforms, Followers represent the number of users subscribed to a given page at the time of posting. Therefore, on Facebook, we can define the Spreading S of a given post j of a Page i as:\nwhere \\(Followers_{it}\\) indicates the number of Followers of the Page i at time t, i.e. the time of posting.\nFor YouTube data, we do not have access to the number of Subscribers at the date of posting as well as the number of Shares. Nonetheless, we can define it using the video Views metric, which specifically measures content spreading, being even more suitable for estimating content diffusion on a video-based platform such as YouTube. Therefore, on YouTube, we define the Spreading S of a given video j published by a Channel i at time t as:\nOn Facebook, interactions are measured by the Total Interactions, encompassing the total number of users\u2019 interactions with the post (the sum of Likes, Comments, and Shares). Therefore, on Facebook, we define the Total Interactions TI of a given post j of a Page i as:\nwhere t is the date in which post j appears. Since YouTube does not provide a share count (and consequently its Shares metric), we define the Total Interactions TI of a given video j of a Channel i published at day t as:\nSince we measure virality on social media as an (exceptional) over-performance of content regarding spreading and users\u2019 interactions, to detect it, we first apply a z-score standardization to both \\(S_{ijt}\\) and \\(TI_{ijt}\\) for each piece of content j from a source i. The mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) employed in the standardization formula are calculated by country and year so that the virality measurement takes into account potential variations of the temporal activity level of the respective country.\nOn Facebook, a post is considered viral if both its z-scores exceed 3. We set the threshold for YouTube at 2.5 to ensure a comparable number of videos and channels as in Facebook. The distributions of the two z-scores for both platforms are shown in Fig.\u00a01a\u2013h). Dotted lines in panels (a, c, e, g) represent the virality threshold for the displayed metric. The plots (b, d, f, h) zoom-in the distribution\u2019s upper tail of the chart to their left, representing the subset of values that exceed the threshold for the displayed metric (reported on the x-axis), distinguishing between viral content (which surpasses both thresholds) and non-viral content (which exceeds the threshold only in the displayed one). These insets reveal that the subset resulting from the combination of overperformances constitutes a small fraction of the distribution tails, especially on Facebook. Essentially, content may induce high interactions levels without widespread diffusion, or conversely, it may fail to engage users despite extensive reach. We also note that both the Spreading z-scores (panels a, e) display very similar distributions, further indicating that, although with different formulations, both metrics work appropriately as spreading estimators for the relative platform.\nFigure\u00a01i presents the distributions of viral posts per source, resulting from the virality detection measures, for Facebook and YouTube. As the Figure shows, despite the differences in sample sizes, both platforms exhibit similar heavy-tailed distributions over different scales reflecting the peculiar dynamics of content virality. If, on the one hand, a limited number of sources succeeded in achieving virality multiple times, it represented a unique or rare event for most of them. These observations further emphasize the exceptional rarity of virality, which reflects the most extreme manifestations of such skewed-distributed phenomena, highlighting the challenges in characterizing it.\nDistributions of z-scores and viral posts per platform.

Dotted lines represent the virality threshold for the displayed metric. The plots (b,d,f,h) zoom-in the distribution\u2019s upper tail of the chart to their left, displaying the subset of values exceeding the threshold for the given metric (reported on the x-axis), showing its breakdown between viral contents (which exceed the threshold in both metrics) and non-viral ones (hence exceeding the threshold only in the displayed metric). (i) Distributions of viral posts per source, resulting from the virality detection measures, on Facebook and YouTube. Facebook sample sizes: Pages = 663, Posts = 9790; YouTube sample sizes: Channels = 236, Videos = 5879.\nAfter defining the procedure for detecting viral posts, we delve into our approach for evaluating the impact of viral events on the performance of Facebook pages and YouTube channels. In terms of attention received, we quantify the performance of a given source by calculating its daily engagement. We define the Engagement \\(E_{it}\\) of a source i at day t as the sum of the Total Interactions TI [as in Eqs.\u00a0(3), and\u00a0(4)] of all its j posts published that day, i.e.:\nIn assessing the total attention a news outlet receives, we interpret higher engagement as indicative of greater user attention, regardless of the number of posts published. This approach is based on the premise that increasing the content volume only results in heightened engagement if the content effectively captures users\u2019 attention. Conversely, high engagement across several posts implies high users\u2019 attention, and calculating its average value would potentially underestimate this effect43.\nOur analysis aims to evaluate the after-effects of a viral event on the source\u2019s performance in terms of attention caught. To inspect the attention dynamics following the event, we first assess whether the engagement received significantly changes after it. To detect a significant variation (either positive or negative) on the Engagement \\(E_{it}\\) after a viral event, we use a comparative interrupted time-series (CITS) design implemented using a Bayesian structural time series model (BSTS, hereafter)45, which has also been used in previous research50. In our approach, we apply BSTS to each viral event, using time windows associated with n weeks ahead and before, with n \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 6]\\), constructed as follows: for any given n, we exclude the day of the viral post and compare the engagement trend during the n weeks following the event to the expected trend based on the n weeks preceding it\u2014hence, having a windows of \\(2n \\times 7\\) days\u2014and controlling for the presence of other viral posts. Based on the BSTS\u2019s results, we then conduct our analysis to address our two research questions, first examining the magnitude of the impact and then its temporal dynamics.\nWe first inspect the BSTS\u2019s results, which provide us with a useful initial overview to help delve into the analysis. We start from the premise that each viral post can have a positive, null, or negative effect on the subsequent engagement in the considered time window. To evaluate the effect, we use two variables provided by the BSTS:\nthe Average Absolute Effect, which indicates whether the impact was positive or negative, along with its magnitude\nthe statistical significance of the effect, which is captured by the p value \\(p_\\alpha\\) of BSTS at a confidence level \\(\\alpha\\). For the analysis, we set \\(\\alpha =0.05\\).\nEffects after virality with increasing time windows. The y-axis represents the percentage of Growth, No Effect, and Decrease cases, for each time scale on the x-axis. Links represent the effects flow between consecutive weeks, color-coded according to the first observed effect (i.e., in the 2-week window).\nIf the effect has no statistical significance at a confidence level \\(\\alpha\\), we consider that virality did not have a discernible impact on users\u2019 engagement\u2014which we refer to as No Effect. Otherwise, if the effect is statistically significant and the observed engagement significantly deviates from the expected trend based on the examined n weeks, we consider that virality had a Growth or Decrease effect on users\u2019 attention as quantified by the Average Absolute Effect. For our analyses, we use the BSTS implementation from the CausalImpact R package51. We begin by examining the proportion of cases that exhibit positive, null, or negative impacts and assess their consistency across various time windows. The results are reported in Fig.\u00a02, which shows the percentage of Growth, No Effect, and Decrease cases on the y-axis for each time scale on the x-axis. The diagram includes links representing the effects flow between consecutive weeks, color-coded according to the first observed effect to maintain a clear visual trajectory through the data stream. A significant observation from this analysis regards the high percentage of cases showing no statistically significant impact on engagement performance. This first finding suggests that virality does not necessarily enhance engagement, as it often results in an indiscernible impact. Secondly, the percentages of Growth and Decrease cases are comparable, with slightly higher occurrences of negative impacts. This suggests that, apart from being infrequent, the impact of a viral event on users\u2019 attention can even be detrimental. Contrary to common expectations34,52,53, virality rarely induces engagement growth. Furthermore, we observe that effects typically emerge or shift between the second and fourth weeks, with the most significant transitions happening from the third to the fourth week. Beyond this period, the consistency of effects is broadly stable. Given the inherently short-term nature of virality, effects observed in larger time scales, such as 5- and 6-week windows, are less likely to be directly attributable to the viral event. In our study, these longer time windows are primarily aimed at assessing the persistence of earlier effects. This allows us to analyze the dynamics from short-term to long-term perspectives in the following sections and distinguish the boundary between these periods.\nAs our first research question aims to assess whether\u2014and how\u2014a viral event impacts users\u2019 attention received by the source after its occurrence, we now deepen the dynamics of the virality effect on Engagement by focusing exclusively on the Growth and Decrease cases. In Fig.\u00a03, we present the joint density of the slopes of the attention trends preceding the viral posts and the absolute effects on engagement after the event. The \u2018Trend Pre Virality\u2019 on the y-axis represents the \\(\\beta _1\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. On the x-axis, we show the Average Absolute Effect on Engagement in the examined n-week window after virality, accounting for its previous trend. Figure\u00a03 reports the values for the 2-week window as an example, while SI Fig.\u00a01 shows the results for other timescales on both platforms which display consistent results. As Fig.\u00a03 shows, the density is split into two opposing quadrants: from growth to decrease and from decrease to growth, highlighting a significant negative correlation between the preceding trend and the consequent absolute effect. This dynamic shows consistency on both platforms and across their timescales, as shown in SI Table\u00a01, which reports the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between the \\(\\beta _1\\) coefficient of the trend preceding virality and the Average Absolute Effect on Engagement.\nDensity of the trend preceding the viral post and the average absolute effect on engagement for the 2-week time window. Trend Pre Virality is the \\(\\beta 1\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS on the weeks preceding virality. Given its previous trend, the average Absolute Effect is the average effect on the Engagement after the viral event. Only events with a statistically significant effect on Engagement are shown.\nTherefore, virality positively impacts users\u2019 engagement when occurring as a sudden event on a declining collective attention. Conversely, when virality manifests following a sustained growth phase, it represents the final burst of that growth process, with users\u2019 attention successively standing on lower levels than its previous phase. These results shed light on the bounded yet elastic nature of collective attention. While additional growth following a sustained growth phase is extremely rare, viral events act as a booster when users\u2019 attention is likely to nearing its lower bound, reactivating the collective response process. By focusing on viral news, these results potentially indicate the presence of two different types of viral events. The first is a \u2018loaded-type\u2019 virality, where attention progressively increases, culminating in the viral event. This type could occur in scenarios where information is gradually revealed, such as sequences of rumors, confirmations, and official announcements. The second type represents a \u2018sudden-type\u2019 virality, with the news emerging unexpectedly as an exogenous event. Based on the release patterns of information, this interpretation could explain the differences between the two types, along with the inverse relationship between the preceding attention pattern and the after-effect of the viral news.\nClassification of viral events based on: Viral Time of the viral post (on rows, indicated by the upper label) and Inter-Event Time (IET) from the previous viral post (on columns, indicated by the lower label). Points are color coded according to the Starting Engagement Level, which is the \\(\\beta _0\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. Points represent the model results using the 2-week time window, only events with a statistically significant effect on Engagement are shown.\nIn SI Figs.\u00a02 and\u00a03 we report the results of the BSTS model by using the daily average Engagement instead of its daily sum, assessing the consistency of our results, while SI Table\u00a02 reports the summary of events analyzed by the BSTS model by using the daily sum Engagement and daily average Engagement.\nTo further characterize such dynamics, we now aim to investigate whether the timing characteristics of the event influence its dynamics of growth and decrease, both in the previous trend and in its after-effect. To do so, we first perform a classification of the viral posts based on two features:\nThe \u2018Viral Time\u2019, indicating the N-th times that the viral post represents achieving virality for its source. For example, if the viral post is the first viral post for the source, its Viral Time will be 1; if it is the tenth, it will be 10, etc.\nThe Inter-Event Time (IET) between the viral post and the previous one of the same source.\nWe partition each feature into 3 classes, defined as follows:\nLess than 10, from 10 to 50, and more than 50 for the Viral Time.\nLess than 48\u00a0h, within 2 weeks, and more than 2 weeks for the IET.\nIn this way, we account for both the proximity of two viral posts and the propensity of the source to reach for virality, at the time of the viral event. Then, in Fig.\u00a04 we reproduce the relationship previously shown in Fig.\u00a03, this time by representing the point color coded according to the initial level of engagement, which is the \\(\\beta _0\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. As in Fig.\u00a03, we use the results of the 2-week time window and represent only the events with a statistically significant effect.\nAs Fig.\u00a04 shows, such dynamics display consistency and invariance anew, also according to current timing characteristics. Firstly, we note how it is less likely for pages with less than ten viral posts to experience a viral post within 48\u00a0h from the previous one. Similarly, it is less likely to experience it more than 2 weeks apart for pages with more than 50 viral times. Apart from these two reasonably expected and inherent differences, the dynamics are reproduced consistently and with similar numbers in all the feature combinations. Moreover, a noteworthy insight is represented by the lower starting Engagement displayed by viral posts with increasing trends and negative after-effects, compared to their counterparts, which instead show higher starting levels. This upshot further agrees with the previously evidenced bounded and elastic behaviors of collective attention. When the viral event follows a sustained growth phase starting from a low-attention level, such growth is unlikely to persist after the event, which will represent its final burst of attention. Conversely, viral events are confirmed to act as a booster when users\u2019 attention is previously decreasing, even more so whether it starts from high initial levels, reactivating the collective response process. Ultimately, our results highlight how virality exhibits invariant dynamics of collective attention mechanisms, which reproduce consistently also regarding timing traits of the event.\nFor a further perspective, we also assess such consistency regarding content type characteristics. In this case, we only perform this analysis on Facebook since all YouTube content is exclusively videos. These results are reported in SI Fig.\u00a04, representing the distributions of content types for the whole dataset and the subsample of viral posts (panel a), the distributions of the Average Absolute Effects per content type (panel b), and its previously mentioned relationship with the Trend Pre Virality per content type (panel c). In this case, we find consistency and invariance of such attention patterns also regarding content characteristics rather than explanatory factors of growth or decline, ultimately indicating how virality is a phenomenon primarily tied to the attention mechanisms of users rather than content features.\nTo conclude our investigation of virality dynamics, we aim to examine the relationship between the speed at which effects manifest and their persistency over time. By using increasingly wider time windows, we can observe the effect of the same viral event from a short-term to a long-term perspective. For each detected effect, its emergence and its subsequent persistency can be determined through a classification based on the output from the BSTS model.\nFor each viral post j of a page i, we define the time of emergence \\(\\tau ^{(em)}_{ij}\\) of its effect:\nas the smallest time window during which a Growth or Decrease effect manifests, where \\(p_{ij}(n)\\) is the p value of BSTS applied to the associated n-week time window. Similarly, the fade-out time, \\(\\tau ^{(f-o)}_{ij}\\), is identified as the earliest time window in which the previously detected effect no longer manifests, i.e.,\nWe notice that the sets associated to the definitions of \\(\\tau ^{(em)}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\tau ^{(f-o)}_{ij}\\) are not empty in the cases treated in this paper. Notice also that the \\(\\tau\\)\u2019s lead to a partition of the collection of the posts with the related pages. Specifically, fixed \\({\\bar{n}}\\), we define\nWe define the persistency \\(\\phi _{kh}\\) as the fraction of posts still having persistent effects at a given week h after their emergence time k, i.e.,\nwhere \\(|\\bullet |\\) is the cardinality of set \\(\\bullet\\), for each k \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 5]\\) and h \\(\\displaystyle \\in [k+1, 6]\\).\nHence, we evaluate the effect\u2019s decay by calculating the fraction of still persistent effects after each week, grouped by their time of emergence. For instance, over the total number of cases where the impact appears 2 weeks after virality, we calculate the proportion of persistent effects in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week. This method allows us to derive the effect\u2019s decay curve for each time of emergence k \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 5]\\).\nAt this stage, we are able to observe the persistency rate up to a minimum of 2 weeks after the viral event. By fitting a negative exponential function of k and power law in h, we can estimate the variation of the exponent of the decay curves based on their time of emergence k as:\nThis procedure allows us to describe the decay behavior of the effects based on their emergence time and to extend it to their unobservable earlier phases as if we approach them asymptotically.\nThe results of the fitting procedure are reported in Table\u00a02, while Fig.\u00a05 shows the graphical representation of the decay curves for each emergence time. Solid lines represent the estimated decay for the observed curves\u2014from the 2nd week to the 5th week of emergence time\u2014along with their observed persistency. The dotted lines represent the corresponding extrapolated decay curves for 0 and 1 week after virality as emergence time. The curves representing extrapolations inherently involve higher uncertainty and should be considered useful asymptotic approximations for understanding the dynamics during their unobservable phases.\nPersistency of the virality effect based on its time of emergence. Solid lines represent the estimated decay for the observed curves\u2014from the 2nd week to the 5th week of emergence time\u2014along with their observed values. The dotted lines represent the corresponding extrapolated decay curves for 0 and 1 week after virality as emergence time.\nAccording to the estimations, in about 50% of cases, the impact either fades out within the first week following the viral event or does not occur. Moreover, the data consistently show that earlier emergences of viral impacts are associated with faster decay across both platforms. This indicates that faster processes tend to fade quicker, while slower ones exhibit more persistence. This finding highlights the elastic nature of collective attention when stretched to its limits. The volatile and fluctuating nature of attention prevents it from being steadily focused, resulting in a trade-off between the rapidity of the effect and its durability. These observations have critical implications for content producers in the digital realm, underscoring a clear distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics of collective attention. From a probabilistic perspective, sudden and disproportionate growth is rare and seldom leads to a noticeable positive impact on engagement. Even when it occurs, its effects tend to fade away swiftly. Conversely, organic and sustained growth, though slower to manifest, tends to have more enduring effects. This contrast emphasizes the transient nature of viral events compared to the lasting effectiveness of consistent engagement, highlighting the importance of gradual and continuous attention-building strategies rather than relying on abrupt surges of visibility.\nThis study examines how viral events affect users\u2019 engagement on social media platforms and the relationship between their emergence and subsequent persistency. Our findings highlight collective attention\u2019s bounded and elastic nature under sudden stress conditions, such as viral events, and have significant implications for the information sources ecosystem in the digital domain, challenging the common assumption that virality regularly enhances user engagement.\nOur analysis reveals that viral events rarely lead to engagement growth, suggesting that the frantic pursuit of sudden visibility is often unproductive. As the virality effect usually depends on the engagement trend preceding the viral post, typically reversing it, we identify two primary types of virality, each corresponding to a different mechanism of collective attention response. The first type, \u2018loaded-type virality,\u2019 is characterized by a gradual increase of engagement that culminates in a final burst of attention in the viral event. The second type, \u2018sudden-type virality,\u2019 occurs when news emerges unexpectedly, similar to an exogenous event, and is the only scenario in which virality enhances users\u2019 engagement, reactivating the collective response process. Regardless of whether the impact is positive or negative, our findings indicate that effects emerging more quickly tend to fade faster, while slower-emerging processes are more persistent over time. As well as being extremely rare, virality does not turn out to be an effective long-term growth strategy.\nThe rapid dissipation of viral impacts illustrates the volatility and fluctuation of collective attention. The resulting trade-off between the rapidity of an impact\u2019s emergence and its lasting presence further emphasizes the critical role of content producers and their challenges in capturing and maintaining users\u2019 engagement. These insights underscore the advantages of establishing a solid and enduring connection with the user base through organic and continued growth strategies rather than mainly aiming for transient\u2014and episodic\u2014viral spikes. In conclusion, although virality can temporarily surge users\u2019 attention, its effects are usually short-lived, making the frantic pursuit of sudden visibility an often fruitless strategy.\nConsequently, this evidence brings significant implications for stakeholders and policymakers in understanding collective online behavior, which could help shape the guidelines for monitoring the evolution of potentially sensitive or harmful content. As viral events exhibit such erratic and transient connotations, focusing solely on them and their forecasting could be costly and inefficient, while monitoring topics showing long-term trends should be less problematic and more effective.\nThis work also presents some limitations. Without having a temporal granularity that allows us, we can not evaluate the Interactions or Spreading evolution over time for each post, only relying on their final value. Nonetheless, our approach relies on the fact that posts on social media generally exhibit a lifetime of 24\u201348\u00a0h27,54,55,56,57. Moreover, since our analysis focuses on news items, which inherently have a limited time reference, a total value should represent an equivalent measurement for each post without representing a distortion towards older ones, considering that it is unlikely that users would interact with old news after long periods.\nThe findings of this study are specifically tied to the platforms analyzed, the type of pages examined, and the period considered. Although the results are consistent with general human dynamics observed in other collective attention studies, they cannot be generalized across all social media platforms. Each platform has distinct user bases and algorithmic characteristics that influence how content is spread and engages users. Additionally, the specificity of the sources analyzed\u2014news outlets\u2014and their content type must be considered. Focusing exclusively on news items offers the advantage of dealing with content inherently tied to specific topics or events, providing a concrete subject matter. However, the dynamics and peculiarities of the news agenda mean that these results may not necessarily apply to the broader spectrum of content creators. Future research should explore various social media platforms and content types to understand better the dynamics of virality and collective attention across different contexts. A more comprehensive picture of how virality functions in the digital landscape can be developed by expanding the study to include a different range of contents and creators.\nFuture research could further explore the impact of factors such as contextual relevance and emotional resonance on users\u2019 perceptions during viral events, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Sentiment analysis of user activity may offer valuable insights into the emotional dynamics driving viral diffusion. Additionally, a cross-platform approach leveraging audience demographics could enhance our understanding of user preferences. The analysis of multimodal data, such as videos and images, would also provide deeper insights into the spreading and engagement mechanisms of diverse content within the digital ecosystem.\nWe are unable to share the raw data obtained from CrowdTangle47.

They have gone hungry. And they haven\u2019t bathed in a month.\nIt\u2019s all part of learning to be a Maasai warrior.\nThey have traveled to Olaimutiai in Kenya\u2019s Narok county from all over the Maasai ancestral lands in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. All 900 were handpicked to take part in a Maasai warrior training camp, which only happens every 10 to 15 years. It teaches Maasai cultural values, leadership skills \u2014 and how to be tough.\nIsaac Mpusia, a 16-year-old high schooler, was visited at home last March by a group of boys who asked for and were offered hospitality, and stayed overnight. The next day, they told him to leave with them.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me (where we were going) and I was worried at first,\u201d he says. But he understood the honor of having been chosen, and went.\nIsaac Mpusia, 16 years old, of the Maasai tribe poses for a photo, during the Enkipaata ceremony, a Maasai male rite of passage, specifically the initiation of boys, marking the transition from childhood to becoming a moran (warrior) in Olaimutiai, Narok County, Kenya Thursday, April 24, 2024.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga)\n\u201cWhen you come here, you learn a lot of things that were done by our parents,\u201d Mpusia says. \u201cYou have to have discipline.\u201d\nTraditionally, transitioning from child to warrior as a Maasai involved taking part in a one-year warrior camp. Maasai youths would be secluded and learn survival skills, bushcraft \u2014 and, if the opportunity arose, how to kill a lion.\nAll that has changed. Although \u201cEnkipaata\u201d \u2014 the official rite of passage that includes warrior training \u2014 has been declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, it has been modernized.\nThe boys now wield long sticks, not blades. No lions are killed. And warrior camp has been condensed down to one month, timed to coincide with school holidays.\nJoyce Naingisa\u2019s son is taking part in this Enkipaata, and although she is just 34 years old, this ritual has already changed considerably in her lifetime.\n\u201cMy husband dropped out of school for a whole year so that he could attend,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now, they are the leaders, and they know the importance of education. So these boys will undergo this rite of passage, but we still make sure that they go to school.\u201d\nNaingisa is a county minister in Narok North County and took a month off work to be here. One of her traditional responsibilities as a Maasai wife and mother is to help build the homes that make up this temporary settlement.\n\u201cWe just came to a plain field here, and now you can see a full house. That is the role of women: to build the shelter,\u201d she explains.\nMen of the Maasai tribe perform traditional dance, during a Maasai male rite of passage, specifically the initiation of boys, marking the transition from childhood to becoming a moran (warrior) in Olaimutiai, Narok County, Kenya Wednesday, April 23, 2024.

They can enter any house. They can all eat. There is no difference between my son, whose mother is here, and the one whose mother is not here.\u201d\nOn the day of their graduation, a ceremonial bull is slaughtered and blessed by the elders, before being shared by everyone.\nStanley Naingisa \u2014 Joyce\u2019s husband and chief of his own age set \u2014 explains the importance of the meat-sharing ceremony.\n\u201cIt teaches them sharing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt teaches them brotherhood. It teaches them being bound together as a community and as a people. For the Maasai, when you say that somebody is of your age set, these are people that have grown with you, and that you are going to grow old with.\u201d\nChildren of the Maasai tribe gather on an open field, during the Enkipaata ceremony, a Maasai male rite of passage, specifically the initiation of boys, marking the transition from childhood to becoming a moran (warrior) in Olaimutiai, Narok County, Kenya Thursday, April 24, 2024.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga)\nThis new generation of Maasai leaders faces unique challenges. Kenya\u2019s 1.2 million Maasai people are profoundly affected both by climate change and the shrinking of the grazing land available to them, both because of urbanization and agricultural expansion.\n\u201cThese children will be change-makers,\u201d says Mosinte Nkoitiko, a 46-year-old cultural chief who traveled here from Tanzania. \u201cThat\u2019s the message that we want to send to them. They are the ones facing these challenges, and we want them to know that they are not alone.\u201d\nWhen this temporary settlement was built for the warrior camp, they also planted 150 seeds and 50 seedlings: trees that they hope will grow with their children.\n\u201cThe trees have been blessed by their fathers and grandfathers, so that they can now have children,\u201d says Joyce Naingisa. \u201cThey are starting a new generation.\u201d\nAt the graduation ceremony, this new generation was officially given the name \u201cIltaretu.\u201d It will include the thousands of boys of the same age who weren\u2019t able to come here in person, but were represented by the 900 boys who were.\n\u201cWhen we meet in future, we shall know each other,\u201d says Isaac Mpusia. \u201cBecause we come from the same age group.\u201d\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Except for some elders living in rural areas, most Maasai people speak the official languages of Kenya and Tanzania\u2014Swahili and English.[6]\nThe Maasai population has been reported as numbering 1,189,522 in Kenya in the 2019 census[2] compared to 377,089 in the 1989 census. However, many Maasai view the census as government meddling and either refuse to participate or actively provide false information.[7][8][9]\nThe Maasai inhabit the African Great Lakes region and arrived via South Sudan.[10] Most Nilotic speakers in the area, including the Maasai, the Turkana and the Kalenjin, are pastoralists and have a reputation as fearsome warriors and cattle rustlers.[10] The Maasai and other groups in East Africa have adopted customs and practices from neighbouring Cushitic-speaking groups, including the age-set system of social organisation, circumcision, and vocabulary terms.[11][12][full citation needed]\nMany ethnic groups that had already formed settlements in the region were forcibly displaced[when?] by the incoming Maasai.[13] Other, mainly Southern Cushitic groups, were assimilated into Maasai society. The Nilotic ancestors of the Kalenjin likewise absorbed some early Cushitic populations.[14]\nThe Maasai territory reached its largest size in the mid-19th century and covered almost all of the Great Rift Valley and adjacent lands from Mount Marsabit in the north to Dodoma in the south.[15] At this time the Maasai, as well as the larger Nilotic group they were part of, raised cattle as far east as the Tanga coast in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania). Raiders used spears and shields but were most feared for throwing clubs (orinka) which could be accurately thrown from up to 70 paces (approx. 100 metres). In 1852, there was a report of a concentration of 800 Maasai warriors on the move in what is now Kenya. In 1857, after having depopulated the \"Wakuafi wilderness\" in what is now southeastern Kenya, Maasai warriors threatened Mombasa on the Kenyan coast.[16]\nBecause of this migration, the Maasai are the southernmost Nilotic speakers. The period of expansion was followed by the Maasai \"Emutai\" of 1883\u20131902. This period was marked by epidemics of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, rinderpest (see 1890s African rinderpest epizootic), and smallpox. The estimate first put forward by a German lieutenant in what was then northwest Tanganyika, was that 90% of cattle and half of wild animals perished from rinderpest. German doctors in the same area claimed that \"every second\" African had a pock-marked face as the result of smallpox. This period coincided with drought. Rains failed in 1897 and 1898.[17]\nThe Austrian explorer Oscar Baumann travelled in Maasai lands between 1891 and 1893 and described the old Maasai settlement in the Ngorongoro Crater in the 1894 book Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle (\"Through the lands of the Maasai to the source of the Nile\"). By one estimate two-thirds of the Maasai died during this period.[18][19][20] Maasai in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania) were displaced from the fertile lands between Mount Meru and Mount Kilimanjaro, and most of the fertile highlands near Ngorongoro in the 1940s.[21] More land was taken to create wildlife reserves and national parks: Amboseli National Park, Nairobi National Park, Maasai Mara, Samburu National Reserve, Lake Nakuru National Park and Tsavo in Kenya; and Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tarangire[22] and Serengeti National Park in what is now Tanzania.\nMaasai are pastoralists and have resisted the urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in both countries.[23]\nThe Maasai people stood against slavery and never condoned the traffic of human beings, and outsiders looking for people to enslave avoided the Maasai.[24]\nEssentially there are twenty-two geographic sectors or sub-tribes of the Maasai community, each one having its customs, appearance, leadership and dialects. These subdivisions are known as 'nations' or 'iloshon' in the Maa language: the Keekonyokie, Ildamat, Purko, Wuasinkishu, Siria, Laitayiok, Loitai, Ilkisonko, Matapato, Dalalekutuk, Ilooldokilani, Ilkaputiei, Moitanik, Ilkirasha, Samburu, Ilchamus, Laikipiak, Loitokitoki, Larusa, Salei, Sirinket and Parakuyo.[25]\nRecent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Maasai people. Genetic genealogy, a tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of modern Maasai.[26]\nThe Maasai's autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to the study's authors, the Maasai \"have maintained their culture in the face of extensive genetic introgression\".[27] Tishkoff et al. also indicate that: \"Many Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in East Africa, such as the Maasai, show multiple cluster assignments from the Nilo-Saharan [...] and Cushitic [...] AACs, in accord with linguistic evidence of repeated Nilotic assimilation of Cushites over the past 3000 years and with the high frequency of a shared East African\u2013specific mutation associated with lactose tolerance.\"[27]\nMaasai display significant West-Eurasian admixture at roughly ~20%. This type of West-Eurasian ancestry reaches up to 40-50% among specific populations of the Horn of Africa, specifically among Amharas. Genetic data and archeologic evidence suggest that East African pastoralists received West Eurasian ancestry (~25%) through Afroasiatic-speaking groups from Northern Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, and later spread this ancestry component southwards into certain Khoisan groups roughly 2,000 years ago, resulting in ~5% West-Eurasian ancestry among Southern African hunter-gatherers.[28][29]\nA 2019 archaeogenetic study sampled ancient remains from Neolithic inhabitants of Tanzania and Kenya, and found them to have strongest affinities with modern Horn of Africa groups. They modelled the Maasai community as having ancestry that is ~47% Pastoral Neolithic Cushitic-related and ~53% Sudanese Dinka-related.[30]\nA Y chromosome study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various Sub-Saharan populations, including 26 Maasai men from Kenya, for paternal lineages. The authors observed haplogroup E1b1b-M35 (not M78) in 35% of the studied Maasai.[31] E1b1b-M35-M78 in 15%, their ancestor with the more northerly Cushitic men, who possess the haplogroup at high frequencies[32] lived more than 13,000 years ago.[33] The second most frequent paternal lineage among the Maasai was Haplogroup A3b2, which is commonly found in Nilotic populations, such as the Alur;[31][34] it was observed in 27% of Maasai men. The third most frequently observed paternal DNA marker in the Maasai was E1b1a1-M2 (E-P1), which is very common in the Sub-Saharan region; it was found in 12% of the Maasai samples. Haplogroup B-M60 was also observed in 8% of the studied Maasai,[31] which is also found in 30% (16/53) of Southern Sudanese Nilotes.[34]\nAccording to an mtDNA study by Castri et al. (2008), which tested Maasai individuals in Kenya, the maternal lineages found among the Maasai are quite diverse but similar in overall frequency to that observed in other Nilo-Hamitic populations from the region, such as the Samburu. Most of the tested Maasai belonged to various macro-haplogroup L sub-clades, including L0, L2, L3, L4 and L5. Some maternal gene flow from North and Northeast Africa was also reported, particularly via the presence of mtDNA haplogroup M lineages in about 12.5% of the Maasai samples.[35][36]\nThe monotheistic Maasai worship a single deity called Enkai, Nkai[13] or Engai. Engai has a dual nature, represented by two colours:[13] Engai Narok (Black God) is benevolent, and Engai Na-nyokie (Red God) is vengeful.[37]\nThere are also two pillars or totems of Maasai society: Oodo Mongi, the Red Cow and Orok Kiteng, the Black Cow with a subdivision of five clans or family trees.[38] The Maasai also have a totemic animal, which is the lion. The killing of a lion is used by the Maasai in the rite of passage ceremony.[39] The \"Mountain of God\", Ol Doinyo Lengai, is located in northernmost Tanzania and can be seen from Lake Natron in southernmost Kenya. The central human figure in the Maasai religious system is the laibon whose roles include shamanistic healing, divination and prophecy, and ensuring success in war or adequate rainfall. Today, they have a political role as well due to the elevation of leaders. Whatever power an individual laibon had was a function of personality rather than position.[40] Many Maasai have also adopted Christianity or Islam.[41] The Maasai produce intricate jewellery and sell these items to tourists.[42]\nEducating Maasai women to use clinics and hospitals during pregnancy has enabled more infants to survive. The exception is found in extremely remote areas.[43] A corpse rejected by scavengers is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace; therefore, it is not uncommon for bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox.[44][45]\nTraditional Maasai lifestyle centres around their cattle,[46] which constitute their primary source of food. In a patriarchal culture that views women as property, a man's wealth is measured in cattle, wives and children. A herd of 50 cattle is respectable, and the more wives and children the better. A man who has plenty of one but not the other is considered to be poor.[47][48]\nAll of the Maasai's needs for food are met by their cattle. They eat their meat, drink their milk daily, and drink their blood on occasion. Bulls, goats, and lambs are slaughtered for meat on special occasions and ceremonies. Though the Maasai's entire way of life has historically depended on their cattle, more recently with their cattle dwindling, the Maasai have grown dependent on food such as sorghum, rice, potatoes and cabbage (known to the Maasai as goat leaves).[49]\nOne common misconception about the Maasai is that each young man is supposed to kill a lion before he can be circumcised and enter adulthood. Lion hunting was an activity of the past, but it has been banned in East Africa \u2013 yet lions are still hunted when they maul Maasai livestock.[50][51] Nevertheless, killing a lion gives one great value and celebrity status in the community.[52][53]\nThe piercing and stretching of earlobes are common among the Maasai as with other tribes, and both men and women wear metal hoops on their stretched earlobes. Various materials have been used to both pierce and stretch the lobes, including thorns for piercing, twigs, bundles of twigs, stones, the cross-section of elephant tusks and empty film canisters.[54] Women wear various forms of beaded ornaments in both the ear lobe and smaller piercings at the top of the ear.[55] Among Maasai males, circumcision is practiced as a ritual of transition from boyhood to manhood. Women are also circumcised (as described below in social organisation).\nThis belief and practice are not unique to the Maasai. In rural Kenya, a group of 95 children aged between six months and two years were examined in 1991/92. 87% were found to have undergone the removal of one or more deciduous canine tooth buds. In an older age group (3\u20137 years of age), 72% of the 111 children examined exhibited missing mandibular or maxillary deciduous canines.[56][57]\nTraditionally, the Maasai conduct elaborate rite of passage rituals which include surgical genital mutilation to initiate children into adulthood. The Maa word for circumcision, \"emorata,\" is applied to this ritual for both males and females.[58] This ritual is typically performed by the elders, who use a sharpened knife and makeshift cattle hide bandages for the procedure.[59]\nThe male ceremony refers to the excision of the prepuce (foreskin). In the male ceremony, the boy is expected to endure the operation in silence. Expressions of pain bring dishonor upon him, albeit only temporarily. Importantly, any exclamations or unexpected movements on the part of the boy can cause the elder to make a mistake in the delicate and tedious process, which can result in severe lifelong scarring, dysfunction, and pain.[60][61][62][63]\nYoung women also undergo female genital mutilation as part of an elaborate rite of passage ritual called \"Emuatare,\" the ceremony that initiates young Maasai girls into adulthood through ritual mutilation and then into early arranged marriages.[64] The Maasai believe that female genital mutilation is necessary and Maasai men may reject any woman who has not undergone it as either not marriageable or worthy of a much-reduced bride price. In Eastern Africa, uncircumcised women, even highly educated members of parliament like Linah Kilimo, can be accused of not being mature enough to be taken seriously.[65] The Maasai activist Agnes Pareyio campaigns against the practice. The female rite of passage ritual has recently seen excision replaced in rare instances with a \"cutting with words\" ceremony involving singing and dancing in its place. However, despite changes to the law and education drives, the practice remains deeply ingrained, highly valued, and nearly universally practised by members of the culture.[66][67]\nUpon reaching the age of 3 \"moons\", the child is named and the head is shaved clean apart from a tuft of hair, which resembles a cockade, from the nape of the neck to the forehead.[42]\nAmong the men, warriors are the only members of the Maasai community to wear long hair, which they weave in thinly braided strands.[68] Graduation from warrior to junior elder takes place at a large gathering known as Eunoto. The long hair of the former warriors is shaved off; elders must wear their hair short. Warriors who do not have sexual relations with women who have not undergone the \"Emuatare\" ceremony are especially honoured at the Eunoto gathering.[69][70][71][72]\nThis would symbolise the healing of the woman.[73]\nTwo days before boys are circumcised, their heads are shaved.[74][75] When warriors go through the Eunoto and become elders, their long plaited hair is shaved off.[76][77]\nMaasai music traditionally consists of rhythms provided by a chorus of vocalists singing harmonies while a song leader, or olaranyani, sings the melody.[78][79] Unlike most other African tribes, Maasai widely use drone polyphony.[80]\nWomen chant lullabies, humming songs, and songs praising their sons. The Namba,[81] a call-and-response harmony pattern, repetition of nonsensical phrases, monophonic melodies, repeated phrases following each verse being sung on a descending scale, and singers responding to their verses are characteristic of singing by women.[82][83][84][85] When many Maasai women gather together, they sing and dance among themselves.[86][87]\nEunoto, the coming-of-age ceremony of the warrior, can involve ten or more days of singing, dancing and ritual. The warriors of the Il-Oodokilani perform a kind of march-past as well as the Adumu, or aigus, sometimes referred to as \"the jumping dance\" by non-Maasai. (Both adumu and aigus are Maa verbs meaning \"to jump\" with adumu meaning \"To jump up and down in a dance\".[88][89][90])\nTraditionally, the Maasai cuisine consisted of raw meat, raw milk, honey and raw blood from cattle\u2014note that the Maasai cattle are of the Zebu variety.\nMost of the milk is consumed as fermented milk or buttermilk (a by-product of butter making). Milk consumption figures are very high by any standards.[91][92]\nThe Maasai herd goats and sheep, including the Red Maasai sheep, as well as the more prized cattle.[93][94]\nAlthough consumed as snacks, fruits constitute a major part of the food ingested by children and women looking after cattle as well as morans in the bush.[95][96][97]\nThe Maasai people traditionally used the environment when making their medicines, and many still do, due to the high cost of Western treatments. These medicines are derived from trees, shrubs, stems, roots, etc. These can then be used in a multitude of ways including being boiled in soups and ingested to improve digestion and cleanse the blood.[98] Some of these remedies can also be used in the treatment or prevention of diseases. The Maasai people also add herbs to different foods to avoid stomach upsets and give digestive aid. The use of plant-based medicine remains an important part of Maasai life.\n[99]\nMaasai clothing symbolises ethnic group membership, a pastoralist lifestyle, as well as an individual's social position.[100] From this they can decide the roles they undertake for the tribe. Jewellery also can show an individual's gender, relationship status, and age.[100] Maasai traditional clothing is both a means of tribal identification and symbolism: young men, for example, wear black for several months following their circumcision.\nThe Maasai began to replace animal skin, calf hides and sheep skin with commercial cotton cloth in the 1960s.[101]\nSh\u00fak\u00e0 is the Maa word for sheets traditionally worn and wrapped around the body. These are typically red, sometimes integrated with other colours and patterns.[102] One-piece garments known as kanga, a Swahili term, are common.[103] Maasai near the coast may wear kikoi, a sarong-like garment that comes in many different colours and textiles[104][105][106]\nA traditional pastoral lifestyle has become increasingly difficult due to modern outside influences. Garrett Hardin's article outlining the \"tragedy of the commons\", as well as Melville Herskovits' \"cattle complex\" influenced ecologists and policymakers about the harm Maasai pastoralists were causing to savannah rangelands. This was later contested by some anthropologists.[107] British colonial policymakers in 1951 removed all Maasai from the Serengeti National Park and relegated them to areas in and around the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA).\nDue to an increasing population, loss of cattle due to disease, and lack of available rangelands because of new park boundaries and competition from other tribes, the Maasai were forced to develop new ways of sustaining themselves. Many Maasai began to cultivate maize and other crops to get by, a practice that was culturally viewed negatively.[107] Cultivation was first introduced to the Maasai by displaced WaArusha and WaMeru women who married Maasai men.[108]\nIn 1975 the Ngorongoro Conservation Area banned cultivation, forcing the tribe to participate in Tanzania's economy. They have to sell animals and traditional medicines to buy food. The ban on cultivation was lifted in 1992 and cultivation became an important part of Maasai livelihood once more. Park boundaries and land privatisation has continued to limit the Maasai livestock's grazing area.[109]\nThroughout the years, various projects have attempted to help the Maasai people. These projects help find ways to preserve Maasai traditions while also encouraging modern education for their children.[110]\nEmerging employment among the Maasai people include farming, business, and wage employment in both the public and private sectors.[111]\nMany Maasai have also moved away from the nomadic life to positions in commerce and government.[112]\nThe Maasai community was reportedly being targeted with live ammunition and tear gas in June 2022 in Tanzania, in a government plan to seize a piece of Maasai land for elite private luxury development. Lawyers, human rights groups, and activists who brought the matter to light claimed that Tanzanian security forces tried to forcefully evict the indigenous Maasai people from their ancestral land for the establishment of a luxury game reserve by Otterlo Business Corporation (OBC) for the royals ruling the United Arab Emirates. As of 18 June 2022, approximately 30 Maasai people had been injured and at least one killed, at the hands of the Tanzanian government Field Force Unit (FFU) while protesting the government\u2019s plans of what it claims are delimiting a 1500 sq km of land as a game reserve, an act which violates a 2018 East African Court of Justice (EACJ) injunction on the land dispute, per local activists. By reclassifying the area as a game reserve, the authorities aimed to systematically expropriate Maasai settlements and grazing in the area, experts warned.[113]\nThis was not the first time Maasai territory was encroached upon. Big-game hunting firms along with the government have long attacked the groups. The 2022 attacks are the latest escalation, which has left more than 150,000 Maasai displaced from the Loliondo and Ngorongoro areas as per the United Nations. A hunting concession already situated in Loliondo is owned by OBC, a company that has been allegedly linked to the significantly wealthy Emirati royal family as per Tanzanian lawyers, environmentalists as well as human rights activists. Anuradha Mittal, the executive director of the environmental think-tank, Oakland Institute cited that OBC was not a \"safari company for just everyone, it has operations for the royal family\".[114]\nA 2019 United Nations report described OBC as a luxury-game hunting company \"based in the United Arab Emirates\" that was granted a hunting license by the Tanzanian government in 1992 permitting \"the UAE royal family to organise private hunting trips\" in addition to denying the Maasai people access to their ancestral land and water for herding cattle.[115]\nWhen approached, the UAE government refrained from giving any statements. Meanwhile, the OBC commented on the matter without addressing alleged links with Emirati royals, stating that \"there is no eviction in Loliondo\" and calling it a \"reserve land protected area\" owned by the government.[114]",

        "article_texts": "### Self-healing 'living skin' can make robots more \u2026\nA combination of cultured cells and silicone could help robots appear more human in future thanks to realistic skin elasticity. And they can smile like us too.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nRobots of the future could be wrapped in lifelike skin that can repair itself, in a similar way to the way human skin heals, thanks to a novel approach involving cultured skin cells.\nThe skin will also appear more lifelike thanks to a new way of attaching it to the robot's skeleton as well the fact that it can repair any cuts or scrapes by itself \u2014 researchers said. They published their findings June 25 in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science.\nArtificial skin has long been touted as a way to make robots appear more human-like \u2014 and cultured skin appears more lifelike than synthetic materials such as latex. But without the right kind of adhesive approach, artificial skin can sag off a robot's frame in a visually disturbing manner.\nRelated link: Watch Boston Dynamics' newest Atlas robot wake up in the creepiest way possible\nRobotics researchers have previously tried to solve the problem of artificial skin sagging off the metallic frame by pinning it down with \"anchors\", hooked or mushroom-shaped structures. This prevents the skin from shifting around atop the robot\u2019s frame, but the adhesive structures can stick out as lumps under the skin \u2014 compromising its human-like appearance.\nIn the new study, researchers pioneered a method whereby the robot's skeleton contains tiny holes into which the artificially grown skin can extend v-shaped hooks known as \"perforation-type anchors\". These keep the artificial skin stuck to the robot while maintaining a smooth and flexible surface.\nThe artificial skin is layered on top of a robot treated with a water-vapor plasma to make it hydrophilic \u2014 in other words, to ensure that liquids are attracted to the surface. This means the cultured skin's gel is pulled deeper into the holes to cling more closely to the surface of the robot.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nOne of the main benefits of this new skin is that it would allow robots to operate alongside humans without experiencing undue wear and tear. Small tears or similar defacements could be repaired without needing to manually repair the robots, the team said. They did not, however, measure how quickly the artificial skin healed after sustaining damage.\nIn one demonstration, researchers recreated the way skin changes when a human smiles. This involved connecting the artificial skin to the robotic face with a sliding layer of silicone underneath. This leads to\"inflating cheeks\", as the muscles tighten and cause the skin to push up at either corner of the mouth. With the perforation anchors, the skin could seamlessly fit the 3D mold of a face, with no protruding bolts or hooks.\nThe researchers also compared the artificial skin applied to a surface with and without the perforation-based anchors. On anchorless surfaces, the skin shrank by as much as 84.5% over the course of seven days, compared with 33.6% on a surface with 0.04-inch (1 millimeter) anchors. Skin contraction on a robot would separate the skin from the robot\u2019s inner frame, ruining its lifelike appearance and potentially causing damage to the skin layer. Skin on surfaces with larger 0.1-inch (3 mm) and 0.2-inch (5 mm) anchors lasted even longer, at 26.4% and 32.2% respectively).\nShoji Takeuchi, a researcher on the study at the Institute of Industrial Science (IIS), the University of Tokyo, told Live Science several steps will still need to be taken before robots are likely to be wearing skin using the team\u2019s methods.\n\"Firstly, we need to enhance the durability and longevity of the cultured skin when applied to robots, particularly by addressing issues related to nutrient and moisture supply,\" he said. \"This could involve developing integrated blood vessels or other perfusion systems within the skin.\"\n\u2014DeepMind experimenting with 'Shadow Hand' that can withstand a severe beating in the name of AI research\n\u2014Robot hand exceptionally 'human-like' thanks to new 3D printing technique\n\u2014Human-like robot tricks people into thinking it has a mind of its own\n\"Secondly, improving the mechanical strength of the skin to match that of natural human skin is crucial. This involves optimizing the collagen structure and concentration within the cultured skin.\"\nTakeuchi also noted that to be truly functional, artificial skin will eventually have to convey sensory information such as temperature and touch to any robot wearing it, as well as be resistant to biological contamination.\nThe scientists said that research into the field could further our understanding of how facial muscles convey emotion \u2014 which could, in turn, drive breakthroughs in surgery to treat conditions like facial paralysis or expand the capabilities of cosmetics and orthopedic surgery. A better grasp of skin adhesion could also prevent needing any v-shaped holes in future robotic frames.\nRory Bathgate is a freelance writer for Live Science and Features and Multimedia Editor at ITPro, overseeing all in-depth content and case studies.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nBut that argument was flawed (in both its facts and punctuation). This meme conflates two unrelated incidents and makes a faulty comparison to the protests against racial injustice in 2020.\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor\u2019s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota \u2014 of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man \u2014 ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile\u2019s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile\u2019s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, \u201cSir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me\u201d--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile\u2019s girlfriend that he wasn\u2019t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez\u2019s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.\nHrynkiw, Ivana. \u00a0 \"Man Sentenced to Death for Third Time in 1997 Memphis Killing.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 AL.com. \u00a0 8 May 2016.\nBaker, Al; Goodman, David; Mueller, Benjamin. \u00a0 \"Beyond the Chokehold: The Path to Eric Garner's Death.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 13 June 2015.\nLi, David. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond's Family Agrees to $20 Million Settlement with Minneapolis Over Police Shooting Death.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 3 May 2019.\nSmith, Mitch. \u00a0 \"Philando Castile Family Reaches $3 Million Settlement.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 26 June 2017.\nSchuppe, Jon. \u00a0 \"From Eric Garner to George Floyd: Protests Reveal How Little Has Changed in 6 Years.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 31 May 2020.\nBrooks, Jennifer. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond Settlement Has Unsettling Side.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Star Tribune. \u00a0 4 May 2019.\nPheifer, Pat. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond Fatally Shot Through Door of Minneapolis Police Car, Sources Say.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Star Tribune. \u00a0 17 July 2017.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Hate Group's Memorial to Justine Ruszczyk Damond Removed by Police.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 December 2017.\nTakei, Carl; Fernandez, Paige. \u00a0 \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ACLU. \u00a0 3 May 2019.\nForliti, Amy. \u00a0 \"Activists: Cop's Shooting of White Woman Treated Differently.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 13 April 2019.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Minneapolis Police Officer Who Killed Justine Damond Given 12-Year Jail Term.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 7 June 2019.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Snopes Collection: George Floyd Protests | Snopes.com\nAdvertisment:\nOn Memorial Day 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, George Floyd died after officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for roughly nine minutes.

This claim was widely shared on social media. However, our verification found that this claim is incorrect.\nSOCIAL MEDIA CLAIM\nA photo of a pregnant girl has recently been posted on social media, claiming she is only 9 years old and from the Philippines.\nThis claim has been widely shared on social media, eliciting mixed reactions. Many believe it to be true.\nThe following is a snapshot from a social media statement on December 23, 2024: \u201cThis girl is only 9 years old and from Gensan, Philippines. The father is just 12 years old. This generation is different. When they grow up, it will be like they are siblings.\u201d\nFacebook Post | Archived Link\nThe photo and its Khmer translation were posted on social media following the English-language claim that the 9-year-old girl became the youngest pregnant girl in Gensan, with a 12-year-old partner.\nHere\u2019s an improved version: \u201cBelow is a snapshot of the news posted on social media by a Facebook page on December 22, 2024, stating: \u201cThe youngest pregnant girl in Gensan is 9 years old. The youngest father is 12. It\u2019s sad to hear, but praying and hoping for your safe and successful delivery.\u201d\nFacebook Post | Archived Link\nPhotos with similar content have also been posted on other social media platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, and Threads, Meta\u2019s new social network.\nBelow is a snapshot of a photo and confirmation post on Instagram from December 23, 2024.\nInstagram Post | Archived Link\nBelow is a snapshot of an Indonesian post on the social network Threads on December 23, 2024, wishing the girl a safe birth.\nThreats Post | Archived Link\nThe claim has recently been posted and shared on TikTok, leading social media users to believe that the girl was indeed pregnant at a young age.\nhttps://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/34964978?key=efdc704e72b90b0230a2d06f0d628e47\nTikTok | Archived Link\nAs it continues to gain traction on social media, this claim can be found in posts by other users. Check out the links here: Link 1 (archived), Link 2 (archived), Link 3 (archived), Link 4 (archived), and Link 5 (archived).\nFACT CHECK\nFact Crescendo initiated verification of the above claim using AI-generated image detectors, uncovering the following facts.\nAnalysis by the website Sight Engine, an AI image monitoring software, reveals that the image of the pregnant girl was created by an AI program and is not a real photograph.\nThe following analysis by the Sight Engine website shows that this image was generated by an artificial intelligence program.\nBelow are the results of an analysis by Sight Engine on another image, showing that it was created by an artificial intelligence program.\nBelow are the results of an analysis by Sight Engine on another image, showing that it was created by an artificial intelligence program.\nIn addition to the analysis by the Sight Engine website, the results from the Hive Moderation website also confirm that this image was created by an artificial intelligence program.\nIn addition to the analysis by the AI image analyzer, an observation of these images revealed some inconsistencies, such as the pregnant girl wearing different shoes and a different dress.\nTo verify this claim, Fact Crescendo also checked media reports in the Philippines but found no recent information supporting it.\nHowever, the issue of underage pregnancies is a real concern in the Philippines, particularly in impoverished areas, and it remains a chronic social problem in the country.\nEleven years ago, a 9-year-old girl in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao became pregnant after being raped by her biological father. Read the full article here.\nThe Trending Facebook page, in Filipino, states that this information is false. The photo of the young-looking pregnant woman is not of the girl who was sexually abused and became pregnant in Gensan, Mindanao.\nThe same Facebook page states that the case of a 9-year-old girl who became pregnant due to sexual abuse was not made public, and her photo was not released because it was sensitive and affected the victim.\nFacebook Post | Archived Link\nBelow is a news report about a 9-year-old girl in the Philippines who became pregnant after being sexually abused by her biological father.\nYouTube\nFollow Us and Stay Up to Date with Our Latest Fact-Checks\nFacebook | Twitter | Telegram | TikTok | WhatsApp | Instgram\nCONCLUSION\nHow about this: \u201cFact Crescendo finds that the above-mentioned claims are false. The claim that this photo shows the youngest pregnant girl in the Philippines is false. The image of the pregnant girl was created by artificial intelligence (AI) software. This AI-generated image is not of a 9-year-old girl who was sexually abused in the Philippines.

Pictured: The press gather at the announcement of the discovery\nThey were found in three burial shafts at depths of 40 feet the sweeping necropolis, that were once Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis.\nArchaeologists opened a coffin with a well-preserved mummy wrapped in cloth inside.\nThey also carried out X-raying visualising the structures of the ancient mummy, showing how the body had been preserved.\nThe sarcophagi (pictured)\u00a0 were found in three burial shafts at depths of 12 metres (40 feet) in the sweeping Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.\nSaqqara is the burial site of the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (pictured in the background, outside where the coffins were unveiled on Saturday\nThe huge find came just over a month after archaeologists in the area found 59 other well-preserved and sealed wooden coffins dating back more than 2,500 years ago. Pictured:\u00a0An archaeologist works on an artefact\nThe\u00a0discovered items date back to the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for some 300 years -\u00a0from around 320 B.C. to about 30 B.C., and the Late Period (664-332 B.C.)\nMore than 40 statues of ancient deities and funerary masks were also discovered at the site, many of which still with their original colours and designs preserved\nOver thousands of years, ancient Egyptians developed elaborate and complex\u00a0funerary practices that they believed were necessary to enter the afterlife.\nThe processes evolved over time, but many elements remained consistent through different ancient Egyptian dynasties.\nThe most classic form of mummification dates back to the 18th Dynasty that spanned the\u00a0the period from 1549/1550 to 1292 BC.\nFirst, the brain was removed. Some say this was by a metal hook inserted through the nose, while others say it was with a rod through the cranium which was used to liquefy the brain.\nThe brain would have then been drained out through the nose before the skull was filled with a mixture of tree resin and fragrances.\nThis stopped the decomposition of any residual brain tissue, and also suppressed the smell.\nThen, the lumbar area was sliced open and the organs of the abdomen were removed.

The burials for the ancient city of Memphis took place in a massive necropolis about 15 miles southwest of Cairo.\nToday, the place where they buried their dead is the archaeological site of Saqqara\u2014and the vast scale of the ancient city of the dead is still coming into focus. A newly unveiled find should help: Researchers just revealed a massive trove of artifacts from the site, including hundreds of ancient sarcophagi in which ancient Egypt\u2019s well-heeled dead were buried.\nThis week, archaeologists from Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the recovery of more than 250 sarcophagi, 150 bronze statues and a variety of other antiquities from the site. The remarkably well-preserved objects in the necropolis are still in good\u2014and sometimes colorful\u2014condition, the researchers say.\nThe laundry list of discoveries includes bronze statues that depict ancient Egyptian gods, including Anubis, Osiris, Nefertem, Isis, and Hathor; 40 wooden coffins with mummies sealed inside; evidence of a burial along with bronze and brass trinkets and adornments, and more.\n\"We found two beautiful wooden statues with golden faces of the deities Isis and Neftis, named the protectors of the coffin,\" excavation director Mohamed Al Saidi tells CBS News\u2019 Ahmed Shawkat. \"They were in a seated position [by one coffin], one of them by the head of the coffin and the other by the feet, in a position called 'the mourners' or 'weepers' for the deceased.\"\nAnother find at the site could reveal even more about ancient Egyptian burial practices. Inside the coffin protected by Isis and Neftis, the team found a papyrus scroll estimated to be up to 30 feet long that could contain parts of the \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d\u2014a collection of ancient Egyptian texts filled with spells and formulas believed to protect the deceased in the afterlife. That scroll has been sent to a lab at the Egyptian Museum.\nThough the discoveries are thousands of years old, many are in excellent condition and still have their paint and gilding intact. \u201cThese figurines, though a bit scuffed, don\u2019t look their age,\u201d writes Gizmodo\u2019s George Dvorsky; \u201cthe items were manufactured around 2,500 years ago.\u201d\nThe cemetery site where the coffins and statues were found was originally named for the ancient Egyptian cat-goddess Bast, due to the numerous statues of the deity discovered there. However, because of continued findings of statues of other gods and mummified animals, the site was renamed the Cemetery of Sacred Animals in 2019.\nThe newest discoveries there, Al Saidi tells CBS News, \u201c[confirm] that the temple wasn\u2019t exclusively for cats, but for other Egyptian deities, too.\u201d\nEgyptian antiquity authorities let the press get a close-up look at the numerous artifacts in a pop-up exhibit near the base of the Step Pyramid of Djoser, the AP reports. The findings will eventually be transferred to the Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo when it opens in November, according to the Washington Post\u2018s Rachel Pannett. The Post reports the Egyptian government hopes the finds will reinvigorate Egypt\u2019s tourism sector, which has suffered from political unrest, pandemic-related travel restrictions, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (Ukrainian and Russian tourists typically make up a large portion of Egypt\u2019s visitors each year.)\nBut Saqqara might have what it takes to tempt tourists curious about Egypt\u2019s ancient past. The necropolis is unlike other burial grounds for ancient Egyptian nobility, Smithsonian magazine\u2019s Jo Marchant reports. Other cemeteries might have sprawling, lavish tombs for individual persons or families. In contrast,\u00a0Saqqara is characterized by \u201cmegatombs\u201d stuffed with hundreds of expensive coffins. While discoveries at the site have spanned 3,000 years\u2014from the time of the first pharaohs to the Roman subjugation of Egypt\u2014most of the sarcophagi found have been from ancient Egypt\u2019s Late Period, from 525 to 332 B.C.E.\nDuring that period, Egypt was largely under Persian occupation. Though the era was characterized by a struggle for Egyptian autonomy, the occupied peoples\u2019 culture thrived under the Persians, who respected Egyptian ways, arts, and religion. By that point, Smithsonian reports, shared tombs had become a common burial practice, necessitated by political instability around 1000 B.C.E.\nBy then, Saqqara was already iconic as home of Egypt\u2019s oldest pyramid, the Step Pyramid of Djoser, constructed around 4,700 years ago. By the Late Period, the site was already ancient and associated with the gods and the divine. A burial place close to the deities of the afterlife would have been coveted by ancient Egyptian nobility\nIn modern times, Saqqara is known\u00a0for other reasons\u2014its seemingly unending archaeological treasures. To date, more than 450 sarcophagi have been discovered there, CBS reports, with many more yet to be uncovered\u2014only 300 feet of the quarter-mile-long site have been excavated thus far. In November 2020, Smithsonian\u2019s Marchant reported at the time, researchers unveiled another trove of over 100 sarcophagi. That find included funerary masks and statues of deities of the dead.\nAt the time, Saqqara archaeologist Salima Ikram told Smithsonian that finding such a trove in an untouched tomb from the Late Period was \u201cextremely significant,\u201d though Campbell Price, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the Manchester Museum in the United Kingdom, added that the sarcophagi were \u201clots more of what we already have.\u201d\nThough the objects may be similar, they make up for their lack of variety with sheer quantity. And given how much territory archaeologists still have to tackle, it\u2019s likely these finds are just the beginning. Saqqara\u2019s dead may have been dormant for millennia, but their resting place is finally giving up its secrets.\nJane Recker |  | Read More\nJane Recker has written for\u00a0Washingtonian Magazine\u00a0and the Chicago Sun-Times.

And it\u2019s Friday, so there\u2019s a new news quiz.\nThe surprise announcement today by a U.S. military spokesman is the first step in President Trump\u2019s plan to pull roughly 2,000 American troops from the country.\nAs recently as Sunday, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, placed conditions on the withdrawal that could leave American forces there for months or even years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nYesterday: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told an audience in Cairo that \u201cthe age of self-inflicted American shame is over\u201d and that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East.\nCloser look: Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech contrasted starkly with a speech in 2009, also in Cairo, by former President Barack Obama, who made an effort to reset relations with the Muslim world in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq war.

they love you.\u00a0 And I just hope that none of you run for President because that \u2014 you may be the one people \u2014 person that we have a problem with, because you are highly respected in our country, and beyond our country.\u00a0 We know what you do with MS-13.\u00a0 We know what you do with the gangs.\u00a0 We know what you do with crime.\u00a0 And we also see what you do on the border.\nBoy, I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 it\u2019s tough stuff.\u00a0 But it could be a lot easier for you, and you could be spread a lot differently if we had the walls.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re winning the battle in a very big way.\nSo I just want to thank you all, in particular, for being with us.\u00a0 Thank you very much, fellas.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Really incredible.\nI want to thank, also, Secretary Nielsen and Commissioner McAleenan for being with us.\u00a0 We made the trip down from Washington.\u00a0 And again, Senator John Cornyn has been an incredible champion of what we\u2019re doing and a very popular man in Texas.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re running, in two years, together.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very good for both of us, I hope.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 I think it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s my honor, John, I want to tell you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The people of Texas love you.\nAnd we have another great friend of mine, Ted Cruz.\u00a0 And he is a friend of mine, except for about four or five months in between.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I was telling John that Ted and I, on the campaign, we liked each other so much.\u00a0 And I said, look, at some time that will end.\u00a0 Right, Ted?\u00a0 But we just \u2014 we actually \u2014 we\u2019d do joint appearances together, and the press would say, \u201cWhen is it going to end?\u201d\u00a0 I said, it\u2019ll happen.\u00a0 Ted would say too, \u201cIt\u2019ll happen.\u201d\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know it would be quite that violent.\u00a0 But then the friendship is at least equal to what it was.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you, because I was here; we had that arena with about 22,000.\u00a0 That was the Houston arena.\u00a0 That was an incredible night, right?\u00a0 And we had, I think, 109,000 or 106,000 people wanting to come.\u00a0 They had thousands outside.\u00a0 And that was a few weeks before the election.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to win.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s going to win nicely.\u201d\u00a0 And I want to just congratulate you.\u00a0 That was not easy.\u00a0 And now he lost and he wants to run for President.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI thought you had to win to run for President.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 But you did a great job, Ted.\u00a0 We appreciate it.\nTexas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, who\u2019s led some incredible cases.\u00a0 Ken, thank you very much.\u00a0 And Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who\u2019s been, again, a friend of mine for a long time.\u00a0 I also want to thank the Governor.\u00a0 He\u2019s going on Fox tonight, and he sends his regards.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to either see him later; he\u2019s coming into Washington.\u00a0 But the Governor, who just had a great campaign also, he\u2019s been fantastic and a big believer in what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 So, say hello to him, and I\u2019ll speak to him later.\nThanks also to Brandon Judd and the National Border Patrol Council.\u00a0 So, Brandon, I\u2019ve known him from the beginning.\u00a0 And almost before I announced, he was for my ideas and he was for us.\u00a0 He was for me.\u00a0 And I appreciate it.\u00a0 And I appreciated all your guys coming up last week.\u00a0 They had a big impact.\u00a0 We said to them, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u00a0 Who knows better than them?\u00a0 He knows better than all of us put together.\u00a0 And that group was fantastic that we had in Washington just a few days ago.\u00a0 And they went on television.\u00a0 And anybody that listened wouldn\u2019t even have a doubt about it.\u00a0 So, Brandon, thank everybody.\u00a0 We appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Done a fantastic job.\nThe Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley Sector \u2014 who is from the sector?\u00a0 Do you have any specific guys here from \u2014 and ladies?\u00a0 Quite a few.\u00a0 Now, are you tougher than the rest?\u00a0 Are you just tougher than the rest?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 But I heard special \u2014 I heard special \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Our acting chief (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, there they are.\u00a0 How are you?\u00a0 Come on over here.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard so much about all of you.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to spend a little time, in a little while, together.\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re walking or flying, but either one is okay with me.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to see a lot.\u00a0 But thank you for being here.\nIn a few moments, the American people will hear directly from our frontline border agents about the tremendous flood of illegal immigration, drug trafficking, human trafficking \u2014 a phenomena that has been going on for a thousand years or more, and that you\u2019d think was something that modern society wouldn\u2019t have.\u00a0 And I hate to tell you that, because of the Internet, it\u2019s worse than ever before.\u00a0 Human trafficking \u2014 it\u2019s a horrible thing.\u00a0 And much of it comes \u2014 it\u2019s a world problem, not a U.S. problem only.\nAnd they come across the border, and it\u2019s a bad thing.\u00a0 And they drive.\u00a0 They just go where there\u2019s no security, where you don\u2019t even know the difference between Mexico and the United States.\u00a0 There\u2019s no line of demarcation.\u00a0 They just go out.\u00a0 And where there\u2019s no fencing or walls of any kind, they just make a left into the United States, and they come in and they have women tied up.\u00a0 They have tape over their mouths \u2014 electrical tape.\u00a0 Usually blue tape, as they call it.\u00a0 It\u2019s powerful stuff.\u00a0 Not good.\nAnd they have three, four, five of them in vans, or three of them in backseats of cars.\u00a0 And they just drive right in.\u00a0 They don\u2019t go through your points of entry.\u00a0 They go right through.\u00a0 And if we had a barrier of any kind \u2014 a powerful barrier, whether it\u2019s steel or concrete \u2014 if we had a barrier, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make that turn.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t even bother trying because they can\u2019t go through the points with people.\u00a0 So we would stop that cold.\u00a0 We would stop it cold.\u00a0 And they can\u2019t fly in, obviously \u2014 for obvious reasons.\u00a0 So we\u2019d stop human trafficking in this section of the world.\u00a0 I think it would stop it 90, 95 percent.\u00a0 A tremendous percentage would stop.\nAnd you also have the criminal gangs coming in.\u00a0 They don\u2019t walk through the points of entry.\u00a0 They come where nobody is around.\u00a0 And you\u2019re talking about hundreds and hundreds of miles.\u00a0 Two thousand miles.\u00a0 But we need 500 miles of border.\nOne of the things that has happened is \u2014 and I was explaining to the two senators and to Dan, in the car \u2014 that one of the things that really is happening is, without saying it too loudly \u2014 and I told them; and Dan said, \u201cCould you repeat that story?\u201d\u00a0 When I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that\u2019s what I said: Mexico is going to pay.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t say they\u2019re going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion.\u00a0 No one is going to write a check.\u00a0 I said they\u2019re going to pay for the wall.\nAnd if Congress approves this incredible trade bill that we made with Mexico \u2014 and Canada, by the way \u2014 but with Mexico, in this case \u2014 they\u2019re paying for the wall many, many times over.\u00a0 And Dan said, \u201cWould you do me a favor?\u00a0 Say that.\u201d\u00a0 And I do say it, but the press sort of refuses to acknowledge it.\nWhen I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that\u2019s what I mean.\u00a0 Mexico is paying for the wall.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t mean, \u201cPlease write me a check.\u201d\u00a0 I mean very simply: They\u2019re paying for it in the trade deal.\u00a0 And sometimes I\u2019d say that.\nSo, hopefully, people will start to understand.\u00a0 Now, if the deal doesn\u2019t get approved by Congress, which would be hard \u2014 because it\u2019s so much better than NAFTA; NAFTA was a horrible trade deal.\u00a0 One of the worst ever made.\u00a0 It really hurt our country.\u00a0 But now we have the USMCA, and it\u2019s a great deal.\u00a0 And I think that you\u2019re going to see some tremendous improvement for the farmers and for the people of Texas.\nSo, law enforcement professionals at DHS, the men and women in this room, have told us what they need to secure our border.\u00a0 These are the people we went to.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only the wall or the barrier; it\u2019s the equipment for seizing the drugs.\u00a0 We have tremendous equipment today.\u00a0 It\u2019s expensive, but tremendous equipment that, when you do drive through one of the ports of entry, we have equipment that we\u2019ll be able to detect the drugs.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the finest in the world, and we\u2019re getting it ready.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of what we\u2019re asking for.\u00a0 It\u2019s not only the wall.\nAnd we\u2019ve taken their recommendations straight to Congress, but Congress, as you know \u2014 the Democrats are holding us up because they don\u2019t want it.\u00a0 They think it\u2019s good politically.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a disaster for them politically.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not doing it for politics; I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s right.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s right.\nAnd before, when I left Washington, I said they can\u2019t have a problem with crime, because the people that are coming in \u2014 the criminals, the gangs, the traffickers, the drugs \u2014 it\u2019s all crime.\u00a0 And the only way you\u2019re going to stop it is the way these people are strongly recommending that it be stopped, Brandon.\nSo, hopefully \u2014 I hear we\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u00a0 I even hear certain members of Congress, the Democrats, are saying, \u201cWe better get this thing going.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t working out too well for us.\u201d\u00a0 Because nobody is going to win the battle of strong borders and no crime, as opposed to open borders and crime doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying: Crime doesn\u2019t matter.\nWe have people that have been so horribly hurt \u2014 families that have been so horribly hurt by people that just come in like it\u2019s \u2014 like just come into the United States, do whatever they want.\u00a0 In many cases, they leave and then they\u2019ll come back.\u00a0 Or in many cases, they stay.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a very good job at the border, considering we\u2019re not given the right laws.\u00a0 We have laws that are so bad.\u00a0 They\u2019re archaic and they\u2019re horrible.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t have the barrier.\nSo our plan includes drug detection technology at our ports; more officers and agents \u2014 far more; more beds to house the inflex of \u2014 the influx of unlawful migrants; medical support; closing the disastrous loopholes that incentivize child smuggling \u2014 the single biggest victims of what is happening at our border: our children.\u00a0 They\u2019re being used by the coyotes.\u00a0 They\u2019re being sold left and right.\u00a0 People are grabbing them to get in because our laws are really lousy.\u00a0 And if you have a child with you, it\u2019s easier to get in.\u00a0 These people know it better than anybody \u2014 far better than the people in Washington.\nAnd I think the biggest victims are children and women.\u00a0 Women would be right there with the children.\u00a0 These are the victims.\u00a0 And it\u2019s women mostly, in terms of the smuggling and what\u2019s going on with that.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to take care of this problem.\u00a0 And to think anybody can even think about fighting it is ridiculous.\nSo we\u2019re going to build a powerful steel barrier.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t want to use concrete.\u00a0 I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll use steel.\u00a0 It\u2019s stronger.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s also more expensive, by the way.\u00a0 But it\u2019s stronger.\u00a0 I\u2019ll use steel.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll call it a steel barrier.\u00a0 Now people should be happy.\u00a0 They said, \u201cConcrete \u2014 we don\u2019t want a concrete wall.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll build a steel wall.\u201d\u00a0 I like it better, if you want to know the truth, Ted.\nAnd we\u2019ll call it a barrier instead of a wall.\u00a0 And I\u2019m okay with that too.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care what you call it, but it\u2019s got to be there.\nDemocrats have refused to listen to the border agents, and they say this is a manufactured crisis.\u00a0 That\u2019s a new sound bite.\u00a0 All over, I turn the television.\u00a0 You know, I call it the opposition party.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the fake-news media.\u00a0 And what happens is, every network has: \u201cManufactured Crisis.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a man-\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Every one of them.\u00a0 It\u2019s like they send out to everybody, \u201cLet\u2019s use this soundbite today.\u201d\u00a0 So it\u2019s a manufa- \u2014 but it\u2019s not.\nWhat is manufactured is the use of the word \u201cmanufactured.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s manufactured by them, every single of the negatives.\u00a0 But they\u2019re not winning, because it\u2019s common sense.\u00a0 It\u2019s common sense.\u00a0 They say a wall is medieval.\u00a0 Well, so is a wheel.\u00a0 A wheel is older than a wall.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I looked, and every single car out there \u2014 even the really expensive ones that the Secret Service uses \u2014 and believe me, they are expensive \u2014 I said, \u201cDo they all have wheels?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 Oh, I thought it was medieval.\u00a0 The wheel is older than the wall.\u00a0 You know that?\nAnd there are some things that work.\u00a0 You know what?\u00a0 A wheel works and a wall works.\u00a0 Nothing like a wall.\nThe government is shut down because Democrats will not fund border security.\u00a0 Plain and simple.\u00a0 And again, more than just the walls.\u00a0 Their open borders agenda threaten all American families, including millions of legal immigrants throughout our nation.\nIn the last two years alone, our courageous ICE officers \u2014 many of whom are with us \u2014 arrested criminal aliens charged with or convicted of 100,000 assaults \u2014 just in the last year \u2014 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.\nWe\u2019re deeply moved to have with us Reggie Singh, whose brother Ronil, Ronil Singh \u2014 incredible guy.\u00a0 I mean, I watched and I\u2019ve rarely felt worse in watching news of our nation than watching your family and the love that you have for your brother.\u00a0 I could see that, Reggie, the way it came through.\u00a0 It came through loud and clear.\nAnd there are so many other people who have the same.\u00a0 Nobody covers them.\u00a0 You know, when they talk about how unfair, how this, how that \u2014 nobody talks about how unfair it is to the victims of the brutal killings.\u00a0 And, by the way, over the years, there\u2019s thousands of them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean hundreds.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean in the teens.\u00a0 I mean thousands of them.\u00a0 And these officers can all tell you about them.\nAnd I\u2019d like to, if I could \u2014 because I watched a family, right around Christmastime, and I watched them suffer \u2014 and I\u2019d like to ask if, Reggie, maybe you could say a few words about your incredible brother, the job he was doing.\u00a0 He was so beloved by the people in the department, and beyond the department.\u00a0 And maybe you could say a few words about your brother.\u00a0 Please.\nMR. SINGH:\u00a0 So, Ronil Singh, originally from Fiji Islands, he always wanted to be in law enforcement.\u00a0 So, legally, we migrated to America to fulfill his dream to join the law enforcement.\u00a0 After \u2014 English is our second language \u2014 he worked on that, got his education, applied for a law enforcement agency.\u00a0 And he was asked to get his citizenship.\u00a0 He worked towards that.\u00a0 And he became a cop \u2014 K-9 \u2014 a corporal K-9.\nAnd the way he was killed, what my family is going through right now, I do not want any other family, law enforcement person to go through that.\u00a0 Whatever it takes to minimize, put a stop to it, my family fully supports it.\nAt 33 years old, Ronil Singh was cremated, and I had to pick up his remains.\u00a0 It breaks my heart.\u00a0 And no one should ever, ever go through that.\u00a0 Looking at the five-month-old baby looking for his dad \u2014 no one should ever go through that on Christmas Day.\nThat\u2019s all.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So, we\u2019re with you.\u00a0 And you know what, right?\nThat was a tough one, too.\u00a0 That was a tough one for a lot of people, not only the family.\u00a0 For a lot of people in this country, that was a tough thing to watch.\nAlso with us, Marie Vega, whose son, Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega Jr. \u2014 who is another person who was loved by so many in the department, on the Border Patrol.\u00a0 We had so many people talking.\u00a0 They\u2019re still talking so much about him.\u00a0 It happened in 2014.\u00a0 He was out fishing with his wife, his parents, and his kids.\nAnd, Marie, I\u2019d like to maybe have \u2014 say a little bit about your son, because he is so loved and respected, still, in this room.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS. VEGA:\u00a0 My name is Marie Vega.\u00a0 We have two sons, my husband Javier and I.\u00a0 I\u2019m very proud of both of them.\u00a0 Both of them Marines.\u00a0 Harvey, at a very young age, expressed a love for law enforcement.\u00a0 And like, you know, the parent that wants the child to grow up and be something, and be a productive human, we supported him.\u00a0 And he showed interest in the police force.\u00a0 Numerous times he rode with the police officers around our town \u2014 surrounding towns.\nWhen he was in high school, he told us that he wanted to be a Marine.\u00a0 And, of course, I was like, \u201cOkay, you want to be a Marine?\u00a0 You\u2019re going to start this.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to follow through.\u00a0 And you\u2019re going to finish it.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s what he did.\u00a0 He became a Marine.\nUpon leaving the United States Marine Corps, he went to college, became a biomed engineer, and almost immediately after graduating, he was offered a job at CHRISTUS Spohn in Kingsville.\u00a0 While working at CHRISTUS Spohn, because he was surrounded by agents and saw how they worked, and still with that love for law enforcement in his heart, he came to me, came to my husband, and said, \u201cMom, Dad, I want to be a Border Patrol agent.\u201d\nAnd, of course, again, you know, \u201cOkay, you want to be a Border Patrol agent?\u00a0 Then you\u2019re going to be a Border Patrol agent.\u201d\u00a0 And he became an agent.\u00a0 I always worried about him, you know, like I worry about our family now.\u00a0 I want them to go to work, be safe, come home to their families safely.\u00a0 And I always \u2014 every day, I was scared that I would lose my son.\u00a0 Never in my wildest dream did I ever imagine my son dying at a family outing.\u00a0 It was supposed to be a peaceful, fun, fishing afternoon, and it didn\u2019t happen that way.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t happen that way because we had a criminal, illegal alien that killed him.\nHe came thinking that he was entitled to one of the two vehicles that we had there.\u00a0 No family, like Mr. Singh said, should go through this.\u00a0 No one.\u00a0 No family should suffer the loss of a child.\u00a0 A parent should not have to bury their child.\nWe need the wall.\u00a0 And when I say we need the wall, I don\u2019t mean just build the wall.\u00a0 There\u2019s other things that we need to do also.\u00a0 We need to enforce immigration laws.\u00a0 We need tougher judges.\u00a0 We need the wall itself.\u00a0 Our Border Patrol agents need to have what they should have \u2014 the equipment, the materials they need to do their job.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And you\u2019re 100 percent right.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHe\u2019s very proud of you right now.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Marie.\u00a0 What Marie said is right; it\u2019s more than just the wall.\u00a0 We have to give these incredible people the tools to work with.\u00a0 We\u2019re not doing that.\u00a0 Politicians in Washington are saying, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u2014 they don\u2019t know the first thing about \u2014 they\u2019ve never been here.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know the first thing about what we\u2019re talking about.\nSo we\u2019re going to hear from a couple of our landowners, a couple of the folks that live in the area and areas that we\u2019re discussing.\u00a0 I think I\u2019d like to start off with our Texas leaders \u2014 and they are indeed leaders \u2014 and say a few words about what we\u2019re here for and what we support, and what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 And we have no choice.\nAnd maybe we\u2019ll start with John Cornyn, Senator Cornyn.\u00a0 Say a few words, please?\nSENATOR CORNYN:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being here and for hearing firsthand from not only the people who suffered at the hands of the crime that occurs as a result of people who don\u2019t come here to achieve their American Dream but people who come here to cause death and destruction and human misery.\nBefore you, you see \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll have somebody go through some of the things that are in front of us.\u00a0 But I see here, for example, heroin and methamphetamine that\u2019s been seized.\u00a0 You see bulk cash \u2014 $362,000.\u00a0 And when the drugs are sold in the United States, they have to get the cash back across the border to the cartels.\u00a0 And you see the sorts of weapons that are used by the drug cartels and others, and you can imagine the violence that goes along with that.\nAnd so when I \u2014 when people like Ted and I hear our colleagues in Washington say that this is a manufactured crisis, we kind of wonder what planet they\u2019ve been living on.\u00a0 Because this is not just about economic migrants.\u00a0 This is about people who exploit the vulnerabilities in our border.\u00a0 This is about the 70,000 people who died of drug overdoses in America.\u00a0 Just last year, a substantial portion was from the heroin that comes from Mexico.\u00a0 Ninety percent of the heroin that is used in the United States comes from Mexico.\nAnd as you point out, the human tragedy associated with human trafficking, sex slavery, modern-day slavery, all of that is associated with our inability to control the way we need to control our southern border.\nSo, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for your concern.\u00a0 And I want to particular thank Mr. Singh and Ms. Vega for their willingness to come and tell their story and their courage.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, John, very much.\u00a0 Senator Cruz?\nSENATOR CRUZ:\u00a0 Well, Mr. President, welcome back to Texas.\u00a0 Glad to welcome you to the Valley.\u00a0 And one of the things you said a minute ago about the men and women here of Border Patrol and ICE is you referred to them as heroes.\u00a0 And that is exactly right.\u00a0 These are brave, courageous leaders.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been out on midnight patrol with the agents here in the RGV Sector.\u00a0 And they have a difficult job that they do each and every day.\u00a0 They risk their lives.\nAll of us, Mr. Singh, our prayers are with your family.\u00a0 The tragedy you endured, nobody should have to endure.\u00a0 Ms. Vega, we love you.\u00a0 And Mr. Vega is sitting back here as well.\u00a0 And this whole community loves the Vega family and has mourned their son\u2019s loss alongside them.\nIllegal immigration produces tragedies every day: human smuggling, drug smuggling, children being abused, women being sexually abused, opioids that are destroying.\u00a0 Last year, 72,000 people lost their lives to drug overdoses.\u00a0 More than car accidents in this country.\u00a0 And much of those drugs are flooding across the southern border.\nAnd so I just want to commend you for standing up and fighting this fight.\u00a0 One thing there\u2019s not a lot of in Washington is backbone.\u00a0 And I want to commend you for helping infuse some more backbone in Washington.\u00a0 This is a fight the people of Texas and the American people want the border secured.\u00a0 They want the federal government to have the backs of the men and women in this room that are risking their lives to keep us safe.\nAnd so thank you for highlighting this crisis.\u00a0 When we see politicians go on TV and say the border is secure and there is no crisis, they are ignoring reality.\u00a0 They\u2019re ignoring the lives that are jeopardized each and every day.\nSo thank you for leading this fight, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Ted.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nDan, if you could say a few words.\u00a0 Also, I\u2019d like to have somebody get up and give us, just for the media, a little definition of exactly what\u2019s in front of us, because it looks pretty brutal.\u00a0 This is not a manufactured deal, as you say.\u00a0 This is the real stuff.\u00a0 And this is nothing compared to what they have.\u00a0 This is actually nothing compared to what they have.\nSo, is somebody going to be able to explain this to us quickly?\nMR. RODRIGUEZ:\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019m Carlos.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Carlos, please, go ahead.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Carlos.\nMR. RODRIGUEZ.\u00a0 Mr. President, welcome to South Texas.\u00a0 I\u2019m Carlos Rodriguez, and I\u2019m the Port Director for the Hidalgo/Anzalduas port of entry.\nBefore you, you see some narcotics that have been seized by the men and women of CBP.\u00a0 As you can see right here on the two tables to my far right and left here, these are 117 kilograms of methamphetamine, and 12 kilograms of heroin that were seized in a commercial conveyance that was making entry at a port of entry.\nOfficers noticed some discrepancies.\u00a0 The conveyance was referred to X-ray technology, and it was \u2014 during the exam, they were able to identify anomalies within the conveyance.\u00a0 With the use of our K-9 detector dogs, we were able to seize this merchandise.\nRight here at this particular one, these are fire extinguishers.\u00a0 These fire extinguishers were intercepted at the Port of Progreso, Texas.\u00a0 It was a male that was driving into the United States, and the two fire extinguishers were used in the importation of methamphetamine and heroin \u2014 100 grams of heroin and 8 kilos of methamphetamine as well.\nAlso, we have some weapons that were seized at our ports of entry, also with the assistance of our federal partners and state partners as well.\nSo we have three colt handguns that are gold-plated, encrusted with diamonds.\u00a0 Those were seized at the Laredo port of entry.\u00a0 You have a AR-15 that was seized with the assistance of our state and local partners, with the taskforce officers.\u00a0 You have an AK-47 that was seized by the officers at the Hidalgo port of entry, going southbound.\u00a0 During a southbound inspection, there was nervous behavior that was displayed by the driver.\u00a0 Subsequently, the officers were able to find the AK-47 hidden in the backseat.\nYou also have a .50 caliber rifle.\u00a0 During the inspection at the port of entry, officers, with the use of NII equipment, or X-rays, were able to detect a compartment.\u00a0 That compartment was found in the backseat of a vehicle.\u00a0 Subsequently, with the assistance of our Homeland Security investigative partners and Air Marine, there was a surveillance that was conducted on the vehicle when it went to a undisclosed location.\u00a0 From that location, a traffic stop was conducted, and the .50 caliber rifle was found, sir.\nNow, these three guns that you see, they\u2019re gold-plated handguns and with diamonds encrusted.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 That says it all.\u00a0 And this is just all recent.\u00a0 This is all very recent.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t have to go very far.\u00a0 This is all very recent.\u00a0 Okay?\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 Good morning, Mr. President, and welcome to the McAllen Station.\u00a0 I am the (inaudible) in charge here at McAllen Station, and we\u2019re very pleased to have you here.\u00a0 $362,000.\u00a0 This was a multi-agency seizure.\u00a0 It actually was detected by a Weslaco Border Patrol Station K-9 handler.\nWhat ended up happening: There was a suspected currency smuggler who (inaudible) a traffic stop, and resulted in further investigation.\u00a0 He gave us consent into his house.\u00a0 K-9 came in, searched, and this was caught.\u00a0 This suspect was suspected also of marriage fraud.\u00a0 He was an overstay.\u00a0 He also had multi-thousands of dollars of financial transactions, all with illicit activity.\u00a0 $362,000 of many.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s (inaudible).\u00a0 And the dogs are incredible, aren\u2019t they?\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 They\u2019re a great tool.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 In terms of finding the drugs but also they find money and drugs.\u00a0 They find drugs.\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 They also find people.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they find people.\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 People that are hidden away.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s pretty incredible.\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 And when we get a chance, I have some other things that I would like to call to your attention.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sure, go ahead.\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 Yes, absolutely.\nI\u2019ll start it from here.\u00a0 Sorry, sir \u2014 if you will.\u00a0 So, Falfurrias checkpoint, which is north of here, two suspects that were being smuggled in the trunk of a car.\u00a0 It just so happens, after records checks were run, one of the subjects actually had an Interpol hit.\u00a0 He was actually wanted out of the Spain for murder.\nHere, we\u2019ve got pictures depicting some seizures of marijuana and firearms.\u00a0 It just so happens, when this multiagency taskforce, Border Patrol included, went to go execute a warrant, the suspects inside the house actually started trying to burn the marijuana, and actually tried to throw it throughout the yard.\u00a0 But we were able to successfully get in, seize the marijuana, and make the arrests, as well as other seizures.\nThis here, very sad.\u00a0 Your words resonate with me.\u00a0 It\u2019s very dangerous.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a vehicle that failed to yield to Border Patrol agents.\u00a0 This vehicle \u2014 eventually, the driver lost control, impelled the vehicle onto a pipe gate.\u00a0 A juvenile died in that vehicle.\u00a0 Fifteen to sixteen other subjects seriously injured.\u00a0 All illegal in the United States.\nHere, you\u2019re seeing the inside of a horse trailer where smugglers endangered these folks that they were smuggling, again, at the Falfurrias checkpoint.\nHere, this is just a couple miles from here, from where we\u2019re standing.\u00a0 This is a tunnel.\u00a0 This is the second tunnel that recently we have located.\u00a0 This is an area that we actually have wall.\u00a0 And we actually have some technology and agents.\u00a0 That piece of area was really important to the criminal organization.\nWe are doing such a great job utilizing the right resource in that particular area, that they\u2019ve become so frustrated they\u2019re using other tactics.\u00a0 They\u2019re actually digging tunnels.\u00a0 This is about 25 feet long, about two to three feet high.\u00a0 We were fortunate enough that when the station next to us, their boat patrol actually launched in our area and went down.\u00a0 They\u2019re very vigilant.\u00a0 They look for new landings.\u00a0 They look for anything that was different the day before.\u00a0 And they were actually able to see \u2014 this was very well hidden \u2014 but they were so vigilant, they found this.\u00a0 There is no telling what all else was going to come through this.\u00a0 But they were successful.\nHere, this vehicle was actually floated across the Rio Grande River with narcotics.\u00a0 Floated on a trailer with barrels.\u00a0 Narcotics in the bed of the truck.\u00a0 Narcotics in the cab of the truck.\nThis is technology that we have here in the McAllen area \u2014 making use of.\u00a0 That group is actually along the Rio Grande, but on the Mexican side, getting ready to cross the United States.\u00a0 That technology is so important so our agents have time to go over there and deter that traffic.\u00a0 We got large groups coming in.\nAnd sadly, this is a deceased subject.\u00a0 Somebody who probably was trying to cross the Rio Grande, who didn\u2019t make it.\u00a0 And he died.\u00a0 He drowned.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nYou want to go ahead?\nMS. LUCIO:\u00a0 Right here, two juveniles from Mexico trying to smuggle over a thousand pounds here, again, in the McAllen area.\u00a0 They actually rammed the vehicle.\u00a0 They rammed into a Border Patrol agent.\u00a0 That\u2019s an assault.\u00a0 They were trying to get away.\u00a0 And two juveniles, over a thousand pounds of marijuana.\nThis is a stash house, Mr. President.\u00a0 The smugglers, they don\u2019t care.\u00a0 They\u2019re treating human beings as commodities.\u00a0 They put them in deplorable situations.\u00a0 Sometimes they\u2019re in these houses up to eight days.\u00a0 Sometimes even more.\u00a0 This is terrible.\u00a0 This is just \u2014 the American people need to understand, like you stated just now, we know better.\u00a0 We know what the cost is to families \u2014 to our families, to our communities, to the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to serve and we\u2019re here to protect not just ourselves and everybody in the country, but even the people who are being taken advantage of.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That was a great presentation.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Very important.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDan?\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PATRICK:\u00a0 Mr. President, I wanted to share with you that our state troopers seized 94.5 pounds of fentanyl last year, which, on the street, breaks down to 21 million lethal doses.\u00a0 Twenty-one million lethal doses.\u00a0 And we talked about our opioid crisis.\nTo those of you who say this is a manufactured crisis, it\u2019s a manufactured cover-up by your opposition.\u00a0 We have \u2014 we had 500,000 people apprehended crossing the border from San Diego to Brownsville last year, more than half in Texas.\u00a0 And most of those in this sector between Brownsville and Falcon Dam.\nWe need the wall.\u00a0 We need the fencing.\u00a0 We have 54 miles.\u00a0 You\u2019re about to build 22 more miles, which leaves about 128 miles.\nOn the other side of the border here, about 10 miles way, Mr. President, there\u2019s a city of a million people \u2014 Reynosa \u2014 without a police force.\u00a0 Every night, running gun fights on the streets between the Mexican marines and the cartels.\u00a0 Just eight miles from here.\u00a0 And anyone who says we don\u2019t need a fence or a wall, or a barrier, or more law enforcement, they\u2019re deceiving the American people.\nSo, you\u2019re right, Mr. President, and we\u2019re with you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they say it\u2019s immoral.\u00a0 What\u2019s immoral is all the killing that\u2019s taking place by people just walking across.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PATRICK:\u00a0 What\u2019s immoral, sir, is deceiving the American people.\u00a0 That\u2019s immoral.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They are.\u00a0 They are.\u00a0 And they know better.\u00a0 And they all know it\u2019s an indefensible position.\u00a0 And even people that aren\u2019t into it like we are, where we\u2019re studying it and working, and we want to end it, and we can\u2019t end it \u2014 everybody knows that what we\u2019re saying is right.\u00a0 They can\u2019t \u2014\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PATRICK:\u00a0 And the economic impact to the country and Texas.\u00a0 We have a million students who aren\u2019t proficient or don\u2019t speak English.\u00a0 And these are good people that want to come here, but there\u2019s a tremendous cost to the taxpayer.\u00a0 That\u2019s about one out of every five students.\u00a0 The healthcare cost and the humanitarian cost.\u00a0 No one should have to die trying to come to America.\u00a0 And the Democrat opposition is creating that situation.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Okay, well, I want to thank you.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PATRICK:\u00a0 Thank you for coming.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I think a lot of people are getting it now because it\u2019s very simple.\u00a0 It\u2019s not complex.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t have a barrier, a very substantial barrier of some kind,\u00a0you\u2019re never going to be able to solve this problem.\u00a0 And everybody gets it \u2014 whether you\u2019re educated in this world or not educated in this world.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to be at all.\u00a0 They all get it.\nAnd that\u2019s why you see Congress now \u2014 Democrats in Congress are coming out and saying, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t like this subject.\u201d\u00a0 There was just a big article \u2014 I won\u2019t give your competition the publicity \u2014 but there was a big article in a very important media outlet that just came out where a lot of the young Democrats just elected to office are breaking up and they\u2019re saying: Hey, wait a minute, this \u2014 our position, meaning, the Democrats\u2019 position of no barrier and no wall, is indefensible.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to happen more and more because it\u2019s common sense.\nMark, would you say something, please?\u00a0 You\u2019ve done a great job.\nDR. ESPER:\u00a0 Well, Mr. President, I\u2019d like to say that, as you well know, the Department of Defense has fully supported the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol with thousands of service members from multiple components.\u00a0 And we continue to lead forward and won the support in the mission as we look ahead.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I called on you, and I called on the Department of Defense to come down and help because we have caravans forming.\u00a0 We have another one forming, believe it or not, in Honduras.\nAnd we pay them million \u2014 tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 They do nothing for us.\u00a0 They do nothing.\u00a0 And if you think that country is trying to stop, don\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 And that goes for Guatemala.\u00a0 That goes for El Salvador.\u00a0 If they want to stop it, they can stop it.\nBut they form and then they come in through Mexico.\u00a0 They break in.\u00a0 And you saw what happened.\u00a0 They broke in because they didn\u2019t have the wall.\u00a0 And I think they\u2019re thinking about building a wall on their southern border now.\nBut I want to thank the military.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been incredible.\u00a0 They came up, and from day one they worked.\u00a0 Nobody has seen anybody work like that.\u00a0 And they put the \u2014 essentially barbed wire \u2014 but it\u2019s called barbed wire times 10.\u00a0 And it was very effective, to put it mildly.\u00a0 Very effective.\u00a0 Without that, we would have been \u2014 it would have been a stampede right into our country.\nSo I just want to thank the military.\u00a0 I know you\u2019re still working with us on it.\u00a0 And I\u2019m \u2014 unfortunately, I have to tell you that they have another one forming.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll handle that as it happens.\nAnd we\u2019re working with Mexico.\u00a0 We appreciate that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re working with Mexico very much.\nAttorney General, pleased say a few words.\nTEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL PAXTON:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 And thank you so much for coming to the border.\u00a0 So many people in Washington talk about the border as if they know what\u2019s going on and they don\u2019t come down here.\u00a0 So thank you.\nAlso, thank you for your vision, your persistance, your willingness to stand, I think, like no other leader we\u2019ve had, President or non-President.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done more for border security, to push this forward.\nAnd look, we have two stories \u2014 horrific stories of people losing their lives.\u00a0 And in Texas, unfortunately, you\u2019re not the only two families that have suffered.\u00a0 We keep track of statistics in Texas related to border security.\u00a0 Our state police has addressed hundreds of thousands of crimes, hundreds of homicides.\u00a0 And so we have hundreds of thousands of stories just like this that have affected real people and our families in Texas.\nAnd so thank you for addressing that.\nWe also hear that the narrative is that the wall won\u2019t work.\u00a0 If you go to El Paso, we\u2019ve put up a barrier there.\u00a0 I think it was under the Bush administration.\u00a0 It\u2019s over 100 miles long.\u00a0 El Paso used to have one of the highest crime rates in America.\u00a0 After that fence went up and separated Juarez, which still has an extremely high crime rate, the crime rates in El Paso are now some of the lowest in the country.\u00a0 So we know it works.\u00a0 So the narrative is incorrect and we\u2019ve tested it in Texas.\nAnd finally, I wanted to say something about your comments about human trafficking.\u00a0 I started a human tracking unit my first year in office.\u00a0 And I did it because \u2014 largely because of the border.\u00a0 We have the second-highest human trafficking rate in the country.\u00a0 Over 300,000 people are victims of that crime every year.\u00a0 That\u2019s the research.\u00a0 Houston is the worst city in America.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re addressing that.\u00a0 And border security will clearly have a positive impact on those horrible and horrific statistics that are affecting our women and our children.\nSo thank you very much, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And thank you very much.\u00a0 And what you\u2019re saying is interesting, because you\u2019ll have a wall or a barrier and then you won\u2019t.\u00a0 And what they do is they walk up, can\u2019t get through.\u00a0 They come in and they eventually find an opening.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the openings where they come in.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to have the openings.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have gates where they come in legally.\u00a0 But other than that, we don\u2019t want to have openings.\nAnd you\u2019ll see the crime rate in this country go way down.\u00a0 And we\u2019re already doing very well in terms of crime rate but it\u2019s not being helped by what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 We could make it a lot better.\u00a0 So I appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Ken.\nBrandon?\nMR. JUDD:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 Mr. President, I came here and this big gentleman right here, he said he didn\u2019t like that .50 cal pointing at his head.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He played football \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR. JUDD:\u00a0 He played football at the University of Missouri.\u00a0 I told him it wouldn\u2019t even put a dent in him.\u00a0 So \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 He might be able to handle it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\nMR. JUDD:\u00a0 He was the right person to put that (inaudible). (Laughter.)\nI appreciate the leadership that you\u2019ve provided.\u00a0 I appreciate the access that you have given our Border Patrol agents to our leaders like Secretary Nielsen.\u00a0 Nobody has ever come down and spoken to our agents as much as Secretary Nielsen has.\u00a0 And we appreciate that.\u00a0 We appreciate the leadership Commissioner McAleenan has provided and the access that you have allowed our agents with these individuals.\nI appreciate you having Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz here with us today.\u00a0 These two individuals played such a huge role in getting Javier Vega\u2019s death declared as a line-of-duty death.\u00a0 Without their leadership, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0 And I appreciate you allowing them to be here.\nFrom a personal experience as a Border Patrol agent, I can tell you what barriers do.\u00a0 I started my career in El Centro, California, 21 years ago.\u00a0 We had very few barriers.\u00a0 We had illegal border crossings that were out of control.\u00a0 It was the busiest sector at that time.\u00a0 We put up physical barriers, and illegal border crossings dropped exponentially.\nI then went to Naco, Arizona.\u00a0 We were the busiest station at that time.\u00a0 2004-2005 we were arresting \u2014 one small station \u2014 we were arresting over 100,000 illegal aliens per year at that station.\u00a0 We built physical barriers.\u00a0 It dropped from 100,000 down to 20,000.\nThat\u2019s how physical barriers work.\u00a0 They work and we appreciate the leadership that you\u2019re providing in order to get us those things that we need, such as personnel, technology, and the infrastructure \u2014 which is barriers.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And, Brandon, it\u2019s been \u2014 you just sit here listening \u2014 it\u2019s like not a contest.\u00a0 There\u2019s no two sides or anything.\u00a0 And all they\u2019re doing is looking at 2020. \u00a0And they figure they can\u2019t win, maybe they can do this, or they can come up with some other issue.\u00a0 I can tell you about another couple of issues they\u2019re using, and \u2014 because we\u2019ve had great achievement.\u00a0 But I won\u2019t consider myself to have that great achievement unless we can straighten out your border.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working on it.\nAnd your son and your brother will not have died in vain.\u00a0 I can tell you that.\u00a0 They will not have died in vain.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very important purpose to all of this.\u00a0 Very important.\nMonty, I agree, that\u2019s a very uncomfortable positon.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t want to be in that chair.\u00a0 But you\u2019re a tough guy.\u00a0 You can handle it.\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Please, say a few words.\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Mr. President, first thing I want to say is thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to come down and address the situation, that we do live on a daily basis \u2014 not only us as ranchers or anything but all the law enforcement agencies.\nSenator Cruz hit it right on the head whenever he said, you know, you got a backbone.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly why we elected you and wanted you in the White House.\u00a0 And we appreciate you not giving up on that.\nI grew up in the Rio Grande Valley.\u00a0 Home.\u00a0 Born and raised down here.\u00a0 My family is \u2014 I\u2019m a third generation down here.\u00a0 Fifteen, twenty years ago, we didn\u2019t have this kind of problem.\u00a0 We had a great flow of illegal immigrants coming across but those people were harmless, and they wanted to come over here for a better life and work.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not the same thing anymore.\u00a0 There\u2019s been many times where we\u2019d be out on the ranch or even at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning \u2014 a cold, drizzly, rainy night \u2014 and have a family come up and beat on my backdoor or on the front porch.\u00a0 I go out there and it\u2019s a family in distress.\u00a0 You know, we feed them.\u00a0 We water them.\u00a0 And they\u2019re asking for help.\u00a0 We\u2019re passionate people, and that\u2019s what we do.\u00a0 So we call for help.\u00a0 We get them over there.\u00a0 We feed them, clothe them \u2014 whatever we have to do.\nUnfortunately, a few times we\u2019ve also had a few young females come up that you could tell had been sexually assaulted.\u00a0 They were scared out of their mind.\u00a0 They get led around in a brush for three or four days and get disoriented on their direction, and told by their coyotes that Houston is right there; this is where you want to go.\u00a0 These people pay $3,000 a piece to come across.\u00a0 It\u2019s everything that they garnish up, you know, wage wise, to pay these people.\nThey walk them 10 miles across the border, walk them around in a brush, and disappear on them.\u00a0 They\u2019re lost.\u00a0 They\u2019re hopeless.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 So they give up and they say, \u201cCan you call Border Patrol for me?\u201d\u00a0 Border Patrol, my hats off to you guys.\u00a0 I see how you work all the time.\u00a0 You\u2019re undermanned \u2014 the sheriff department, everybody.\nWe got a great sheriff in Hidalgo County and probably call him my friend as well.\u00a0 Anytime that we\u2019ve had any instances \u2014 I lost my father five years ago, and when that happened there was a lot of traffic going on.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t live at the ranch at the time, but I would have to go out there every night.\u00a0 So I was a constant bother to the sheriff, I\u2019m sure.\u00a0 And he was there to help me all the time.\nThese guys, the Border Patrol right now, their hands are tied.\u00a0 And these immigrants, they know it.\u00a0 So they know that they get over here and they\u2019re going to get caught, but they\u2019re going to get let go.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 to me, that\u2019s something that I think that really needs to be addressed.\nAnd, yes, I agree with the wall.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of farmers who \u2014 and landowners that I do know that are on the river and they\u2019re a little upset because of the eminent domain.\u00a0 That brings up the question there.\u00a0 As far as, you know, all the acreages that they\u2019re losing with that wall, maybe there is something that you can devise with those owners and say, \u201cHey, you know, what?\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to drill right down through the middle of your property.\u00a0 Let\u2019s rearrange it and get a little closer to the river or something.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that that would probably forego \u2014 and you\u2019ll see a lot more cooperation with that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We should look at that, okay?\u00a0 I think \u2014 I agree with you.\u00a0 I think you\u2019re right, Monty.\u00a0 I agree with you.\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And the laws are a big problem.\u00a0 You know, they call one \u201ccatch-and-release.\u201d\u00a0 You catch them and you release them.\u00a0 You know, other countries, for the most part, you go into the country and they say, \u201cExcuse me. \u00a0These people \u2014 get out.\u00a0 You have to get out.\u00a0 Sorry.\u201d\u00a0 And nobody tries to get in because they know they can\u2019t.\nWith us, we take them through court proceedings.\u00a0 We have to hire hundreds of judges.\u00a0 We got hundreds of judges.\u00a0 Hundreds of judges.\u00a0 You go through a proceeding.\u00a0 They check you in.\u00a0 Then they can\u2019t do the proceeding because there\u2019s 800,000 people now waiting.\u00a0 Eight \u2014 think of it \u2014 800,000 people.\u00a0 How ridiculous is this?\u00a0 If they set one foot on U.S. property, so to speak, they end up having to go to a trial.\nSo they take their name and they say, \u201cYou can go now.\u00a0 Come back in three years.\u00a0 You have a trial.\u201d\u00a0 This is the United States law, by the way.\u00a0 And made worse by the Ninth Circuit.\u00a0 The Ninth Circuit is a disaster.\u00a0 Made worse by the Ninth.\nIf you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you\u2019re on the other side of what everybody in this room is all about \u2014 and, frankly, what most of the people in the country are all about \u2014 it\u2019s almost like an automatic loss.\u00a0 It\u2019s like an automatic loss.\u00a0 They take a case to the Ninth Circuit that\u2019s nowhere near the Ninth Circuit, that has nothing to do with the Ninth Circuit.\nSo we\u2019re bucking a bad system and we\u2019re bucking a lot of things that are bad.\u00a0 And we\u2019re apprehending more people than ever apprehended before.\u00a0 But the laws are really against us, and we\u2019re doing well anyway.\u00a0 But we have to do much better.\u00a0 And we can do only better if we have a physical barrier.\u00a0 Because this way we don\u2019t have the \u2014 even with the bad laws, you have a physical barrier, they can\u2019t come on to the \u2014 into our country.\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 If I may, Mr. President, I also \u2014 I married into a law enforcement family.\u00a0 Agent Jaime Zapata was the agent killed down in Mexico.\u00a0 You know, it was pretty hard going through that, and I kind of feel you all\u2019s pain.\u00a0 Jaime and I were not all that close at first.\u00a0 We gained \u2014 you know, became really, really good friends after that.\u00a0 After that happened, I don\u2019t\u2019 know how, but the killers, when they got \u2014 or went up to D.C., they were allowed to bring their entire family and put them up on the taxpayer\u2019s dollar.\u00a0 And in front of his parents, just paraded them around.\u00a0 And it was like a stab in the back, you know, for the government that he gave his life for.\u00a0 And it just \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 When was that?\u00a0 How long ago?\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Sir, that was the \u2014 that was right out last year when they finally went to sentencing.\u00a0 So \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Convicted?\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Somebody took the fall for it.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say that it was the correct person that pulled the trigger.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 bad stuff.\nMR. AWBREY:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Pastor, please.\nPASTOR PE\u00d1A:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Mr. President, first for coming to Texas and \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPASTOR PE\u00d1A: \u2014 to the Rio Grande Valley.\u00a0 I especially want to thank you for calling this what it is: a humanitarian crisis.\u00a0 When you use that language, it really set bells to ringing, because that is what it is.\u00a0 People in my profession see the suffering, the human suffering, brought by drugs, by the arms that are brought across, making our communities more violent.\u00a0 The trafficking of women and children especially, and boys, and young males as well.\nAnd the truth that needs to be talked about, that is seldom talked about, is that amount of underreporting of the crime.\u00a0 When these things happen in the shadows, people are not always eager to point out the crimes that are taking place.\u00a0 And it goes underreported.\nBut people in my profession, especially Spanish-speaking pastors \u2014 especially Spanish-speaking pastors in this sector \u2014 know firsthand the human suffering, the human toll that\u2019s taking place because of the onslaught.\u00a0 The sickness, the disease, the lack of sanitation that\u2019s going on because of the bunch-up at the border and people are trying to come in.\nSo I just want to give a very heartfelt thanks because I have had the privilege of visiting with you before.\u00a0 I know your heart of compassion, although some don\u2019t want to paint you as having a heart of compassion.\u00a0 I know you as the man that does have this heart of compassion that\u2019s genuine and authentic.\nAnd the fact that you called it what it is \u2014 it\u2019s a crisis and a humanitarian crisis.\u00a0 And again, the pastors that I\u2019m here representing today salute you and thank you for wanting to bring an end to untold suffering that\u2019s taking place on our southern border.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Pastor.\u00a0 Very nice.\u00a0 Good to see again.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nPASTOR PE\u00d1A:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nCommissioner?\nCOMMISSIONER MCALEENAN:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously, you came to the right part of the border to really bring this border security and humanitarian crisis into focus, number one, for illegal crossings, and number two, for hard narcotics, both between our ports of entry \u2014 as you saw from the briefing \u2014 and at the ports.\u00a0 And then the humanitarian cost.\nThe families and children crossing here \u2014 over half the families that cross our border in the whole country, cross here in South Texas.\u00a0 And so we have our men and women, our trained law enforcement officers, dealing with care for children and families in a very challenging environment.\nAnd so I just wanted to say I\u2019m incredibly proud of the agents, officers, Air Marine professionals that are serving down here, staying focused on the mission despite the challenging environment at this time.\u00a0 I\u2019m very proud of the briefing from Melisa and Carlos, telling you \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Absolutely.\nCOMMISSIONER MCALEENAN:\u00a0 \u2014 with their heart and soul what they do every day to protect our country and our fellow citizens.\nAnd I just got to say, the resources the administration is asking for from Congress are directly targeted at all three elements of this crisis: the border barrier, technology, agents and officers that we need to address the security threats.\u00a0 And we\u2019re building a new barrier, as the Lieutenant Governor noted, starting in February, right here.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAlso, the technology at the ports of entry to stop the drugs, that\u2019s a critical element.\u00a0 And very importantly, you asked for humanitarian resources, and we can provide different facilities medical support to get our agents out of the childcare business and help protect families that are crossing and end this violence cycle.\u00a0 It\u2019s all controlled by violent criminals in Mexico, primarily transnational criminal organizations.\u00a0 And we want to combat that with these resources.\nSo thank you for the support.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Commissioner.\nCOMMISSIONER MCALEENAN:\u00a0 We look forward to showing you more on the river.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A little while.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be there in a little while.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nOne of the things that Dan Patrick suggested, which I thought was very interesting, was give the state of Texas a relatively small amount of money and they\u2019ll build a wall themselves, because they want to build it.\u00a0 And I thought that was not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Although, I still think I could do it cheaper than you.\u00a0 I still think I could do \u2014\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR PATRICK:\u00a0 (Inaudible) do it cheap?\u00a0 If you could do it cheaper \u2014 we\u2019re working to help you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But I do like the idea, and we\u2019re going to look at a couple of ways of doing it where you guys get it up.\u00a0 You do things very well in Texas.\u00a0 And I like that idea.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll take a look.\nAnd, Dan, could I ask you to say a few words, please?\nMR. BIBLE:\u00a0 Yes, Mr. President.\u00a0 I\u2019m Dan Bible.\u00a0 I\u2019m the Field Office Director with ICE ERO for the San Antonio field office.\u00a0 And with the inflow of the immigrants that are coming across in these unprecedented numbers, our officers are \u2014 also are coming down to the border to support that effort to deal with the women and children.\nBut those are the same officers that we would be using in the community itself looking for those public safety threats and criminal aliens, which are now reprogramed to come down here to deal with the humanitarian crisis.\nOver this past year, I would say over half the time, those officers on my taskforce and everything were brought back down to deal with these crises.\u00a0 And when we look at the family units and stuff that come across in reality, we either just release them right out the door once we take them in, if they\u2019re not in a composition that can into one of our family residential centers.\u00a0 But even if they get to one of our family residential centers, due to some of the legal decisions and stuff, we have 20 days to release them from there.\u00a0 So essentially, they\u2019re being just released to the street as well.\nSo pulling our officers away from doing criminal enforcement \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 These are the laws.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Terrible.\nMR. BIBLE:\u00a0 \u2014 to just basically release family units, it\u2019s kind of deteriorating the system and also reducing the secondary \u2014 or the secondary \u2014 how would you put it?\u00a0\u2014 barrier for them to keep coming, right?\u00a0 I mean, once you get past \u2014 if all my agents are at the border doing this, they kind of get a free run in the communities, which make the communities less safe.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You\u2019re right.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just what\u2019s going on at the border.\u00a0 That\u2019s really almost a lesser problem.\u00a0 They get through the border and then they filter out throughout the whole country.\u00a0 And you have MS-13 all over Long Island and all over other places.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting them out by the thousands.\u00a0 The ICE folks are doing incredibly at getting them out.\u00a0 And they are rough and tough, but the \u2014 I will tell you a little secret: ICE is a lot rougher and a lot tougher and a lot smarter.\u00a0 But still, it\u2019s a lot of people.\u00a0 A lot of people that they have to get out.\nBut it\u2019s not the crime at the border, which has got its own problems; it\u2019s what happens once they get through the border and they\u2019re dispersed or they disperse themselves throughout the country.\u00a0 And all of that crime is because of it.\nYes, John.\nSENATOR CORNYN:\u00a0 Mr. President, just before you \u2014 before we end tonight, I suspect we\u2019ll hear from Secretary Nielsen, who\u2019s doing a great job at DHS, but I just want to acknowledge all the local officials here \u2014 the mayors, and the country judges, and others \u2014 who supports these men and women who wear the green and blue uniforms.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s great.\nSENATOR CORNYN:\u00a0 And who basically end up having to try to manage this humanitarian crisis that floods across the border because of the gaps in our law that you\u2019ve already described.\nAnd, you know, we are set up as a country to deal with legal immigration.\u00a0 We applaud legal immigration.\u00a0 But illegal immigration, particularly when it floods over here, we\u2019re just not prepared for, especially with these large caravans.\u00a0 And it\u2019s created a humanitarian crisis that these men and women, who are local elected officials, have had to deal with.\nSo I wonder if you wouldn\u2019t mind if we asked them to stand \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Please.\nSENATOR CORNYN:\u00a0 \u2014 so we can recognize them and thank them for what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you, John, very much.\nSecretary?\nSECRETARY NIELSEN:\u00a0 Well, sir, I think everyone here today said it so well.\u00a0 What I would tell you is it\u2019s not status quo.\u00a0 It is a crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s a humanitarian crisis.\u00a0 It\u2019s clearly a security crisis.\u00a0 For those who would like to put their heads in the sand and pretend that it\u2019s \u201cmanufactured,\u201d it\u2019s not only an insult and deeply disturbing to those that have lost loved ones, but it\u2019s an insult to our country, sir.\u00a0 This is a crisis.\nAnd when a crisis mandates (inaudible) is a decisive leader with a vision.\u00a0 That\u2019s what you have.\u00a0 You continue each day to make it very clear to Congress what the crisis is and what the men and women here today have told you is needed to address it, and they refuse to do it.\nSo I hope today they\u2019re watching.\u00a0 I hope they take a cue from you, they decide to be leaders, and they do what this country needs to help us secure it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Secretary.\u00a0 And you\u2019re doing a great job.\u00a0 And you\u2019re working hard, I will tell you that.\u00a0 She\u2019s working hard.\u00a0 Every time I speak to her, she\u2019s in a different location, usually along the border.\u00a0 And, Commissioner, you and the Secretary, and everybody else, we appreciate it very much.\nAnd we\u2019re getting there.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u00a0 And I have to say that my sacred duty \u2014 most sacred duty as President is to defend the people of our nation.\u00a0 That\u2019s whether it\u2019s from foreign nations or along a border.\u00a0 It\u2019s all defending our people and defending them properly and strongly and really rightly and justly.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nAnd it would be a lot easier for me not to do this.\u00a0 It would be a lot easier not to say anything and let this go on.\u00a0 This should have been taken care of 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.\u00a0 It should have been taken care of.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen all the speeches made by all the Presidents and a lot people that worked under the Presidents.\u00a0 And you say, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0 Nothing happened.\nThey were going to build this wall in 2003, in 2006.\u00a0 They were going to build it 20 years ago.\u00a0 They were going to build it forever.\u00a0 And little sections got built.\u00a0 And I will say, we\u2019ve done a lot of renovation.\u00a0 And we have a lot of new wall going up where we took down wall because it was in such bad shape, and we put new wall up.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done a lot of work, but we have work to do.\nSo I hope that the Democrats get together and work on a problem that is truly \u2014 it\u2019s compassion, it\u2019s everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s also national security, just like it\u2019s a foreign country, it\u2019s a foreign world.\u00a0 In many cases, it is a foreign country.\u00a0 We\u2019re under attack in a certain way.\u00a0 And we\u2019re certainly under attack by criminal gangs, by criminals themselves, by the human traffickers, and by drugs of all kinds.\u00a0 Much of it comes through the southern border.\nAnd if we can do a really great job \u2014 and we will \u2014 of putting up the barriers, putting up the walls, putting up the fences, putting up everything that we have planned; fixing what\u2019s good, but isn\u2019t working so well anymore because it\u2019s decrepit, it\u2019s old, it\u2019s torn up from years of abuse and all of the things that happen \u2014 we will have done a great service.\nAnd you know, somebody was saying that moving the embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 I got it done.\u00a0 Every President talked about it for many, many years \u2014 for decades.\u00a0 They talked about it.\u00a0 They campaigned on it.\u00a0 In every instance, they campaigned on it, they never got it done.\u00a0 Same thing here.\u00a0 Same exact thing.\u00a0 I got that done, and we\u2019re going to get this done too.\nAnd this is really the defense of our country.\u00a0 And this is compassion, Pastor, very much so.\u00a0 It\u2019s compassion.\u00a0 It\u2019s compassion for our people.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want to have situations like Reggie had and his family, where he lost a brother who was special.\u00a0 Or like Marie had with your son who was \u2014 I mean, they still talk about your son as being such a great young man.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want that.\nSo we\u2019re working very hard.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get it done.\u00a0 We are really on the right side of an issue.\u00a0 And I think actually \u2014 I know you don\u2019t see it yet, but I have feel about things.\u00a0 I think the other side is starting to get it.\u00a0 I may be wrong, but I really believe the other side is starting to understand what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 They\u2019re on the wrong side of a very important issue.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have it taken care of.\nI want to thank everybody.\u00a0 And you\u2019re right, John, the mayors and all the representatives have done such a great job.\u00a0 And some of you I know.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get to know the rest of you.\nBut especially, I want to thank Marie and I want to thank Reggie for being here.\u00a0 And I want to thank all of the people \u2014 Border Patrol.\u00a0 Brandon, thank you very much.\u00a0 Border Patrol, ICE, and law enforcement for being here.\u00a0 We are with you 1,000 percent.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2:21 P.M. CST\n\n### Remarks During a Roundtable Discussion on Border Security in \u2026\nABOUT\u00a0SEARCH\nThe President. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. And it's an incredible honor to be here and to meet. We just said hello to Reggie. And I've seen so much with Reggie and his incredible brother and family. And we're with you. You know that, right? You know that. And we're here to make a tour, in a little while, of the border. And we have fantastic people with us, including our great Senators from the State of Texas. And thank you very much, John and Ted. Thank you very much for being here. And our Lieutenant Governor, who's been my friend for a long time. And I also hear your son is doing a very good job.\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick of Texas. He's working hard every day.\nThe President. I hear he's doing a good job. So I want to thank all of you for being here. And we're going to go around the table and say a few words. Attorney General, thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. What a job you've done. A big victory you had recently too.\nTexas State Attorney General W. Kenneth Paxton, Jr. We did.\nThe President. It was a very important victory. The individual mandate. We're going to see if that holds up, because it should. That was the excuse they had, and now we'll see if it holds up. Right? But I think you're going to be in great shape.\nI'm honored to be in McAllen, Texas, with the heroes of Border Patrol. And they are heroes. You know, you have so much\u2014Border Patrol, ICE, and law enforcement generally\u2014you take so much heat. You take so much abuse from people that don't know what they're talking about. I want to just say that you have a friend with this administration, and you have a friend with me. Nobody does a better job. Nobody does a better job.\nAnd I have to add that you have no idea how much you're loved by the public. Maybe not by the fake news, but you're loved by the public. [Laughter] Beyond belief. And that includes my friend Brandon. And, Brandon, thank you very much for being so great. You've been getting the word out, how important it is\u2014border security. The wall or the steel barrier, they can have any name they want, but we have to have it. And it's going to happen.\nBut law enforcement and ICE and Border Patrol, incredible job you're doing. The public loves you. The public\u2014not like; they love you. And I just hope that none of you run for President, because that\u2014you may be the one people\u2014person that we have a problem with. Because you are highly respected in our country and beyond our country. We know what you do with MS-13. We know what you do with the gangs. We know what you do with crime. And we also see what you do on the border.\nBoy, I'll tell you what, it's tough stuff. But it could be a lot easier for you, and you could be spread a lot differently, if we had the walls. And we'll get it. We'll get it. I think we're winning the battle in a very big way.\nSo I just want to thank you all, in particular, for being with us. Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you very much. Really incredible.\nI want to thank, also, Secretary Nielsen and Commissioner McAleenan for being with us. We made the trip down from Washington. And again, Senator John Cornyn has been an incredible champion of what we're doing and a very popular man in Texas. And I think we're running in 2 years together. And that's very good for both of us, I hope. [Laughter] I think it is. It's my honor, John, I want to tell you. The people of Texas love you.\nAnd we have another great friend of mine, Ted Cruz. And he is a friend of mine, except for about 4 or 5 months in between. [Laughter] I was telling John that Ted and I, on the campaign, we liked each other so much. And I said, look, at some time that will end. Right, Ted? But we just\u2014we actually\u2014we'd do joint appearances together, and the press would say, \"When is it going to end?\" I said, \"It'll happen.\" Ted would say too, \"It'll happen.\" We didn't know it would be quite that violent. But then the friendship is at least equal to what it was.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you, because I was here; we had that arena with about 22,000. That was the Houston arena. That was an incredible night, right? And we had, I think, 109,000 or 106,000 people wanting to come. They had thousands outside. And that was a few weeks before the election. And I said: \"I think he's going to win. I think he's going to win nicely.\" And I want to just congratulate you. That was not easy. And now he lost, and he wants to run for President. And I said, \"I thought you had to win to run for President.\" Right? But you did a great job, Ted. We appreciate it.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's led some incredible cases. Ken, thank you very much. And Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who's been, again, a friend of mine for a long time. I also want to thank the Governor. He's going on Fox tonight, and he sends his regards. And we're going to either see him later; he's coming into Washington. But the Governor, who just had a great campaign also, he's been fantastic and a big believer in what we're doing. So say hello to him, and I'll speak to him later.\nThanks also to Brandon Judd and the National Border Patrol Council. So Brandon, I've known him from the beginning. And almost before I announced, he was for my ideas and he was for us. He was for me. And I appreciate it. And I appreciated all your guys coming up last week. They had a big impact. We said to them, \"What do you want?\" Who knows better than them? He knows better than all of us put together. And that group was fantastic that we had in Washington just a few days ago. And they went on television, and anybody that listened wouldn't even have a doubt about it. So, Brandon, thank everybody. We appreciate it very much\u2014done a fantastic job.\nThe Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector\u2014who is from the sector? Do you have any specific guys here from\u2014and ladies?\nParticipants. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Quite a few. Now, are you tougher than the rest? Are you just tougher than the rest? I don't know. Maybe. But I heard special\u2014I heard special\u2014\u2014\nParticipant. Our Acting Chief, Raul Ortiz.\nThe President. Oh, there they are. How are you? Come on over here. Come here, man. Come here.\n[At this point, the President stood and shook hands with Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz.]\nActing Chief Ortiz. Nice to meet you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you. That's fantastic. And I've heard so much about all of you. And we're going to spend a little time, in a little while, together. I don't know if we're walking or flying, but either one is okay with me. We're going to see a lot. But thank you for being here.\nIn a few moments, the American people will hear directly from our frontline border agents about the tremendous flood of illegal immigration, drug trafficking, human trafficking\u2014a phenomena that has been going on for a thousand years or more, and that you'd think was something that modern society wouldn't have. And I hate to tell you that because of the internet, it's worse than ever before. Human trafficking, it's a horrible thing. And much of it comes\u2014it's a world problem, not a U.S. problem only.\nAnd they come across the border, and it's a bad thing. And they drive. They just go where there's no security, where you don't even know the difference between Mexico and the United States. There's no line of demarcation. They just go out, and where there's no fencing or walls of any kind, they just make a left into the United States. And they come in, and they have women tied up. They have tape over their mouths\u2014electrical tape. Usually blue tape, as they call it. It's powerful stuff. Not good.\nAnd they have three, four, five of them in vans, or three of them in back seats of cars. And they just drive right in. They don't go through your points of entry. They go right through. And if we had a barrier of any kind\u2014a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete\u2014if we had a barrier, they wouldn't be able to make that turn. And they wouldn't even bother trying, because they can't go through the points with people. So we would stop that cold. We would stop it cold. And they can't fly in, obviously\u2014for obvious reasons. So we'd stop human trafficking in this section of the world. I think it would stop it 90, 95 percent. A tremendous percentage would stop.\nAnd you also have the criminal gangs coming in. They don't walk through the points of entry. They come where nobody is around. And you're talking about hundreds and hundreds of miles. Two thousand miles. But we need 500 miles of border.\nOne of the things that has happened is\u2014and I was explaining to the two Senators and to Dan in the car\u2014that one of the things that really is happening is, without saying it too loudly\u2014and I told them. And Dan said, \"Could you repeat that story?\" When I say Mexico's going to pay for the wall, that's what I said: Mexico's going to pay. I didn't say they're going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion. No one is going to write a check. I said they're going to pay for the wall.\nAnd if Congress approves this incredible trade bill that we made with Mexico\u2014and Canada, by the way\u2014but with Mexico, in this case, they're paying for the wall many, many times over. And Dan said: \"Would you do me a favor? Say that.\" And I do say it, but the press sort of refuses to acknowledge it.\nWhen I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that's what I mean. Mexico's paying for the wall. And I didn't mean, \"Please write me a check.\" I mean very simply: They're paying for it in the trade deal. And sometimes I'd say that.\nSo, hopefully, people will start to understand. Now, if the deal doesn't get approved by Congress, which would be hard\u2014because it's so much better than NAFTA; NAFTA was a horrible trade deal. One of the worst ever made. It really hurt our country. But now we have the USMCA, and it's a great deal. And I think that you're going to see some tremendous improvement for the farmers and for the people of Texas. So law enforcement professionals at DHS, the men and women in this room, have told us what they need to secure our border. These are the people we went to. It's not only the wall or the barrier; it's the equipment for seizing the drugs. We have tremendous equipment today. It's expensive, but tremendous equipment that, when you do drive through one of the ports of entry, we have equipment that will be able to detect the drugs. And it's the finest in the world, and we're getting it ready. It's part of what we're asking for. It's not only the wall.\nAnd we've taken their recommendations straight to Congress, but Congress, as you know\u2014the Democrats are holding us up because they don't want it. They think it's good politically. I think it's a disaster for them politically. But I'm not doing it for politics; I'm doing it because it's right. I'm doing it because it's right.\nAnd before, when I left Washington, I said they can't have a problem with crime, because the people that are coming in\u2014the criminals, the gangs, the traffickers, the drugs\u2014it's all crime. And the only way you're going to stop it is the way these people are strongly recommending that it be stopped, Brandon.\nSo, hopefully\u2014I hear we're making a lot of progress. I even hear certain Members of the\u2014of Congress, the Democrats, are saying: \"We better get this thing going. This isn't working out too well for us.\" Because nobody is going to win the battle of strong borders and no crime, as opposed to open borders and crime doesn't matter. Because that's what they're saying: Crime doesn't matter.\nWe have people that have been so horribly hurt\u2014families that have been so horribly hurt by people that just come in like it's\u2014like just come into the United States, do whatever they want. In many cases, they leave and then they'll come back. Or in many cases, they stay. And we've done a very good job at the border, considering we're not given the right laws. We have laws that are so bad. They're archaic, and they're horrible. And we don't have the barrier.\nSo our plan includes drug detection technology at our ports; more officers and agents\u2014far more; more beds to house the inflex of\u2014the influx of unlawful migrants; medical support; closing the disastrous loopholes that incentivize child smuggling\u2014the single biggest victims of what is happening at our border: our children. They're being used by the coyotes. They're being sold left and right. People are grabbing them to get in because our laws are really lousy. And if you have a child with you, it's easier to get in. These people know it better than anybody, far better than the people in Washington.\nAnd I think the biggest victims are children and women. Women would be right there with the children. These are the victims. And it's women mostly in terms of the smuggling and what's going on with that. So we're going to take care of this problem. And to think anybody can even think about fighting it is ridiculous.\nSo we're going to build a powerful steel barrier. They didn't want to use concrete. I said: \"Okay, I'll use steel. It's stronger.\" It's also more expensive, by the way. But it's stronger. I'll use steel. So we'll call it a steel barrier. Now people should be happy. They said, \"Concrete\u2014we don't want a concrete wall.\" I said, \"That's okay, we'll build a steel wall.\" I like it better, if you want to know the truth, Ted. And we'll call it a barrier instead of a wall. And I'm okay with that too. I don't care what you call it, but it's got to be there.\nDemocrats have refused to listen to the border agents, and they say this is a manufactured crisis. That's their new sound bite. All over, I turn the television. You know, I call it the opposition party. It's called the fake news media. And what happens is, every network has: \"Manufactured Crisis.\" This is a\u2014every one of them. It's like they send out to everybody, \"Let's use this sound bite today.\" So it's a manufactured\u2014but it's not.\nWhat is manufactured is the use of the word \"manufactured.\" It's manufactured by them, every single of the negatives. But they're not winning, because it's common sense. It's common sense. They say a wall is medieval. Well, so is a wheel. A wheel is older than a wall. [Laughter] And I looked, and every single car out there, even the really expensive ones that the Secret Service uses\u2014and believe me, they are expensive\u2014I said, \"Do they all have wheels?\" \"Yes.\" Oh, I thought it was medieval. The wheel is older than the wall. You know that?\nAnd there are some things that work. You know what? A wheel works, and a wall works. Nothing like a wall.\nThe Government shut down because Democrats will not fund border security. Plain and simple. And again, more than just the walls. Their open borders agenda threaten all American families, including millions of legal immigrants throughout our Nation.\nIn the last 2 years alone, our courageous ICE officers, many of whom are with, arrested criminal aliens charged with or convicted of 100,000 assaults\u2014this is in the last year\u201430,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.\nWe're deeply moved to have with us Reggie Singh, whose brother Ronil, Ronil Singh\u2014incredible guy. I mean, I watched, and I've rarely felt worse in watching news of our Nation than watching your family and the love that you have for your brother. I could see that, Reggie, the way it came through. It came through loud and clear.\nAnd there are so many other people who have the same. Nobody covers them. You know, when they talk about how unfair, how this, how that\u2014nobody talks about how unfair it is to the victims of these brutal killings. And by the way, over the years, there's thousands of them. I don't mean hundreds. I don't mean in the teens. I mean thousands of them. And these officers can all tell you about them.\nAnd I'd like to, if I could\u2014because I watched a family, right around Christmastime, and I watched them suffer. And I'd like to ask if, Reggie, maybe you could say a few words about your incredible brother, the job he was doing. He was so beloved by the people in the department and beyond the department. And maybe you could say a few words about your brother. Please.\nReggie Singh, brother of deceased Newman, CA, Police Officer Ronil Singh. So, Ronil Singh\u2014we are originally from Fiji Islands. He always wanted to be in law enforcement. So, legally, we migrated to America to fulfill his dream to join the law enforcement. After\u2014English is our second language. He worked on that, got his education, applied for a law enforcement agency. And he was asked to get his citizenship. He worked towards that. And he became a cop\u2014K-9\u2014corporal K-9.\nAnd the way he was killed, what my family is going through right now, I do not want any other family, law enforcement person to go through that. Whatever it takes to minimize, put a stop to it, my family fully supports it.\nAt 33 years old, Ronil Singh was cremated, and I had to pick up his remains. It breaks my heart. And no one should ever, ever go through that. Looking at that 5-month-old baby looking for his dad, no one should ever go through that on Christmas Day.\nThat's all. That's it. Participant. Bless you.\nThe President. Thank you. So we're with you. And you know that, right?\nMr. Singh. Yes.\nThe President. That was a tough one too. That was a tough one for a lot of people, not only the family. For a lot of people in this country, that was a tough thing to watch.\nAlso with us, Marie Vega, whose son, Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr.\u2014who is another person who was loved by so many in the department, on the Border Patrol. We had so many people talking. They're still talking so much about him. It happened in 2014. He was out fishing with his wife, his parents, and his kids.\nAnd, Marie, I'd like to maybe have\u2014say a little bit about your son, because he is so loved and respected, still, in this room. Please. Thank you. Thank you.\nMarie Vega, mother of deceased Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr. My name is Marie Vega. We have two sons, my husband Javier and I. I'm very proud of both of them. Both of them marines. Harvey, at a very young age, expressed a love for law enforcement. And like, you know, the parent that wants the child to grow up and be something, and be a productive human, we supported him. And he showed interest in the police force. Numerous times he rode with the police officers around our town\u2014surrounding towns.\n[Ms. Vega continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]\nWe need the wall. And when I say we need the wall, I don't mean just build the wall. There's other things that we need to do also. We need to enforce immigration laws. We need tougher judges. We need the wall itself. Our Border Patrol agents need to have what they should have\u2014the equipment, the materials they need to do their job.\nThe President. Thank you very much. And you're a hundred-percent right. Thank you.\n[The President hugged Ms. Vega.]\nThe President. He's very proud of you right now. Thank you very much, Marie. What Marie said is right: more than just the wall. We have to give these incredible people the tools to work with. We're not doing that. Politicians in Washington are saying, \"Oh, you don't\"\u2014they don't know the first thing about\u2014they've never been here. They don't know the first thing about what we're talking about.\nSo we're going to hear from a couple of our landowners, a couple of the folks that live in the area and areas that we're discussing. I think I'd like to start off with our Texas leaders\u2014and they are indeed leaders\u2014and say a few words about what we're here for and what we support and what's going to happen. And we have no choice.\nAnd maybe we'll start with John Cornyn, Senator Cornyn. Say a few words, please?\nSenator John Cornyn III. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being here and for hearing firsthand from not only the people who suffered at the hands of the crime that occurs as a result of people who don't come here to achieve their American Dream, but people who come here to cause death and destruction and human misery.\n[Sen. Cornyn continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] And as you point out, the human tragedy associated with human trafficking, sex slavery, modern-day slavery, all of that is associated with our inability to control the way we need to control our southern border.\nSo thank you for being here.\nThe President. Thank you.\nSen. Cornyn. Thank you for your concern. And I want to particularly thank Mr. Singh and Ms. Vega for their willingness to come and tell their story and their courage.\nThe President. Thank you, John, very much. Senator Cruz?\nSenator R. Edward \"Ted\" Cruz. Well, Mr. President, welcome back to Texas.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you, yes.\nSen. Cruz. Glad to welcome you to the Valley. And one of the things you said a minute ago about the men and women here of Border Patrol and ICE is, you referred to them as heroes. And that is exactly right. These are brave, courageous leaders. I've been out on midnight patrol with the agents here in the RGV Sector. And they have a difficult job that they do each and every day. They risk their lives.\n[Sen. Cruz continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nAnd so thank you for highlighting this crisis. When we see politicians go on TV and say the border is secure and there is no crisis, they are ignoring reality. They're ignoring the lives that are jeopardized each and every day.\nSo thank you for leading this fight, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you very much, Ted. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.\nDan, if you could say a few words. Also, I'd like to have somebody get up and give us, just for the media, a little definition of exactly what's in front of us, because it looks pretty brutal. This is not a manufactured deal, as you say. This is the real stuff. And this is nothing compared to what they have. This is actually nothing compared to what they have.\nSo is somebody going to be able to explain this to us quickly?\nParticipant. Yes.\nHidalgo/Pharr/Anzalduas Port of Entry Port Director Carlos Rodriguez. Yes, I'm Carlos.\nThe President. Good. Carlos, please, go ahead. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Carlos.\nDirector Rodriguez. Mr. President, welcome to South Texas. I'm Carlos Rodriguez, and I'm the Port Director for the Hidalgo/Anzalduas Port of Entry.\nBefore you, you see some narcotics that have been seized by the men and women of CBP. As you can see right here on the two tables to my far right and left here, these are 117 kilograms of methamphetamine and 12 kilograms of heroin that were seized in a commercial conveyance that was making entry at our port of entry.\n[Director Rodriguez continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nYou also have a .50-caliber rifle. During the inspection at the port of entry, officers, with the use of NII equipment, or X-rays, were able to detect a compartment. That compartment was found in the back seat of a vehicle. Subsequently, with the assistance of our Homeland Security investigative partners and Air Marine, there was a surveillance that was conducted on the vehicle when it went to a undisclosed location. From that location, a traffic stop was conducted, and the .50-caliber rifle was found, sir.\nNow, these three guns that you see, they're gold-plated handguns and with diamonds encrusted.\nThe President. Okay. I think that says it all. And this is just all recent. This is all very recent. They didn't have to go very far. This is all very recent. Okay?\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection McAllen Station Patrol Agent in Charge Melissa A. Lucio. Good morning, Mr. President, and welcome to the McAllen Station. I am the Patrol Agent in Charge here at McAllen Station, and we're very pleased to have you here\u2014$362,000. This was a multi-agency seizure. It actually was detected by a Weslaco Border Patrol Station K-9 handler.\nWhat ended up happening: There was a suspected currency smuggler who came to a traffic stop, and resulted in further investigation. He gave us consent into his house. K-9 came in, searched, and this was caught. This suspect was suspected also of marriage fraud. He was an overstay. He also had multi-thousands of dollars of financial transactions, all illicit activity\u2014$362,000 of many.\nThe President. Wow. That's something. And the dogs are incredible, aren't they?\nAgent Lucio. They're a great tool.\nThe President. In terms of finding the drugs, but also they find money and drugs. They find drugs.\nAgent Lucio. They also find people.\nThe President. And they find people.\nAgent Lucio. People that are hidden away.\nThe President. Yes, it's pretty incredible.\nAgent Lucio. And when we get a chance, I have some other things that I would like to call to your attention.\nThe President. Sure, go ahead.\nAgent Lucio. Yes, absolutely.\nI'll start it from here. Sorry, sir\u2014if you will. So Falfurrias checkpoint, which is north of here, two suspects that were being smuggled in the trunk of a car. It just so happens, after records checks were run, one of the subjects actually had an Interpol hit. He was actually wanted out of the Spain for murder.\n[Agent Lucio continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]\nThis is technology that we have here in the McAllen area\u2014making use of. That group is actually along the Rio Grande, but on the Mexican side, getting ready to cross the United States. That technology is so important so our agents have time to go over there and deter that traffic. We've got large groups coming in.\nAnd sadly, this is a deceased subject. Somebody who probably was trying to cross the Rio Grande, who didn't make it. And he died. He drowned. The President. Thank you.\nYou want to go ahead?\nAgent Lucio. Right here, two juveniles from Mexico trying to smuggle over a thousand pounds here, again, in the McAllen area. They actually rammed the vehicle. They rammed into a Border Patrol agent. That's an assault. They were trying to get away. Two juveniles, over a thousand pounds of marijuana.\n[Agent Lucio continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]\nThe American people need to understand, like you stated just now, we know better. We know what the cost is to families\u2014to our families, to our communities, to the country. We're here to serve and we're here to protect not just ourselves and everybody in the country, but even the people who are being taken advantage of.\nThe President. That was a great presentation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Very important.\nDan?\nLt. Gov. Patrick. Mr. President, I wanted to share with you that our State troopers seized 94\u00bd pounds of fentanyl last year, which, on the street, breaks down to 21 million lethal doses. Twenty-one million lethal doses. And we talked about our opioid crisis.\n[Lt. Gov. Patrick continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nOn the other side of the border here, about 10 miles way, Mr. President, there's a city of a million people\u2014Reynosa\u2014without a police force. Every night, running gun fights on the streets between the Mexican marines and the cartels. Just 8miles from here. And anyone who says we don't need a fence or a wall or a barrier or more law enforcement, they're deceiving the American people.\nSo you're right, Mr. President, and we're with you.\nThe President. And they say it's immoral. What's immoral is all the killing that's taking place by people just walking across.\nLt. Gov. Patrick. What's immoral, sir, is deceiving the American people. That's immoral.\nThe President. They are. They are. And they know better. And they all know it's an indefensible position. And even people that aren't into it like we are, where we're studying it and working, and we want to end it, and we can't end it\u2014everybody knows that what we're saying is right. They can't\u2014\u2014\nLt. Gov. Patrick. And the economic impact to the country and Texas. We have a million students who aren't proficient or don't speak English. And these are good people that want to come here, but there's a tremendous cost to the taxpayer. That's about one out of every five students. The health care cost and the humanitarian cost. No one should have to die trying to come to America. And the Democrat opposition is creating that situation.\nThe President. Yes. Okay, well, I want to thank you.\nLt. Gov. Patrick. Thank you for coming.\nThe President. And I think a lot of people are getting it now, because it's very simple. It's not complex. If we don't have a barrier, a very substantial barrier of some kind, you're never going to be able to solve this problem. And everybody gets it\u2014whether you're educated in this world or not educated in this world. You don't have to be at all. They all get it.\nAnd that's why you see Congress now\u2014Democrats in Congress are coming out and saying, \"Hey, we don't like this subject.\" There was just a big article\u2014I won't give your competition the publicity\u2014but there was a big article in a very important media outlet that just came out where a lot of the young Democrats just elected to office are breaking up and they're saying: \"Hey, wait a minute, this\u2014our position,\" meaning, the Democrats' position of no barrier and no wall, \"is indefensible.\"\nAnd it's going to happen. It's going to happen more and more because it's common sense.\nMark, would you say something, please? You've done a great job.\nSecretary of the Army Mark T. Esper. Well, Mr. President, I'd like to say that, as you well know, the Department of Defense has fully supported the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol with thousands of servicemembers from multiple components. And we continue to lead forward and willing to support in the mission as we look ahead.\nThe President. And I called on you, and I called on the Department of Defense to come down and help, because we have caravans forming. We have another one forming, believe it or not, in Honduras.\nAnd we pay them million\u2014tens of millions of dollars. They do nothing for us. They do nothing. And if you think that country is trying to stop, don't believe it. Okay? And that goes for Guatemala. That goes for El Salvador. If they want to stop it, they can stop it.\nBut they form, and then they come in through Mexico. They break in. And you saw what happened. They broke in because they didn't have the wall. And I think they're thinking about building a wall on their southern border now.\nBut I want to thank the military. They've been incredible. They came up, and from day one, they worked. Nobody has seen anybody work like that. And they put the\u2014essentially barbed wire, but it's called barbed wire times 10. And it was very effective, to put it mildly. Very effective. Without that, we would have been\u2014it would have been a stampede right into our country.\nSo I just want to thank the military. I know you're still working with us on it. And I'm\u2014unfortunately, I have to tell you that they have another one forming. And we'll handle that as it happens.\nAnd we're working with Mexico. We appreciate that. But we're working with Mexico very much.\nAttorney General, please say a few words.\nState Attorney General Paxton. Sure. And thank you so much for coming to the border. So many people in Washington talk about the border as if they know what's going on, and they don't come down here. So thank you.\nAlso, thank you for your vision, your persistence, your willingness to stand up, I think, like no other leader we've had, President or non-President. You've done more for border security, to push this forward.\n[State Attorney General Paxton continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] And finally, I wanted to say something about your comments about human trafficking. I started a human tracking unit my first year in office. And I did it because\u2014largely because of the border. We have the second highest human trafficking rate in the country. Over 300,000 people are victims of that crime every year. That's the research. Houston is the worst city in America. And so we're addressing that. And border security will clearly have a positive impact on those horrible and horrific statistics that are affecting our women and our children.\nSo thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThe President. And thank you very much. And what you're saying is interesting, because you'll have a wall or a barrier, and then you won't. And what they do is they walk up, can't get through. They come in and they eventually find an opening. And it's the openings where they come in. And we don't want to have the openings. We're going to have gates where they come in legally. But other than that, we don't want to have openings.\nAnd you'll see the crime rate in this country go way down. And we're already doing very well in terms of crime rate, but it's not being helped by what's going on. We could make it a lot better. So I appreciate it very much. Thank you very much, Ken.\nBrandon?\nNational Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd. Absolutely. Mr. President, I came here, and this big gentleman right here, he said he didn't like that .50-cal pointing at his head. [Laughter] He played football\u2014\u2014\nThe President. [Laughter] That's right.\nMr. Judd. He played football at the University of Missouri. I told him it wouldn't even put a dent in him. So\u2014[laughter].\nThe President. That's right. He might be able to handle it. I don't know.\nMr. Judd. He was the right person to put that\u2014[inaudible]. [Laughter]\nI appreciate the leadership that you've provided. I appreciate the access that you have given our Border Patrol agents to our leaders like Secretary Nielsen. Nobody has ever come down and spoken to our agents as much as Secretary Nielsen has. And we appreciate that. We appreciate the leadership Commissioner McAleenan has provided and the access that you have allowed our agents with these individuals.\n[Mr. Judd continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nThat's how physical barriers work. They work, and we appreciate the leadership that you're providing in order to get us those things that we need, such as personnel, technology, and the infrastructure, which is barriers. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you very much. And, Brandon, it's been\u2014you just sit here listening\u2014it's, like, not a contest. There's no two sides or anything. And all they're doing is looking at 2020. And they figure they can't win, maybe they can do this, or they can come up with some other issue. I can tell you about another couple of issues they're using, and\u2014because we've had great achievement. But I won't consider myself to have that great achievement unless we can straighten out your border. And we're working on it.\nAnd your son and your brother will not have died in vain. I can tell you that. They will not have died in vain. It's a very important purpose to all of this. Very important. Monty, I agree, that's a very uncomfortable position. [Laughter] I don't know. I wouldn't want to be in that chair. But you're a tough guy. You can handle it.\nEdinburg, TX, resident Monty Awbrey. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Please, say a few words.\nMr. Awbrey. Mr. President, first thing I want to say is thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to come down and address the situation, that we do live on a daily basis\u2014not only us as ranchers or anything, but all the law enforcement agencies.\nSenator Cruz hit it right on the head whenever he said, you know, you got a backbone. And that's exactly why we elected you and wanted you in the White House. And we appreciate you not giving up on that.\n[Mr. Awbrey continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nAnd yes, I agree with the wall. There's a lot of farmers who\u2014and landowners that I do know that are on the river, and they're a little upset because of the eminent domain. That brings up the question there. As far as, you know, all the acreages that they're losing with that wall, maybe there is something that you can devise with those owners and say: \"Hey, you know, what? We don't want to drill right down through the middle of your property. Let's rearrange it and get a little closer to the river or something.\" And I think that that would probably forego\u2014and you'll see a lot more cooperation with that.\nThe President. We should look at that, okay? I think\u2014I agree with you. I think you're right, Monty. I agree with you.\nMr. Awbrey. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. And the laws are a big problem. You know, they call one catch-and-release. You catch them, and you release them. You know, other countries, for the most part, you go into the country and they say: \"Excuse me. These people\u2014get out. You have to get out. Sorry.\" And nobody tries to get in because they know they can't.\nWith us, we take them through court proceedings. We have to hire hundreds of judges. We got hundreds of judges. Hundreds of judges. You go through a proceeding. They check you in. Then they can't do the proceeding because there's 800,000 people now waiting. Eight\u2014think of it\u2014800,000 people. How ridiculous is this? If they set one foot on U.S. property, so to speak, they end up having to go to a trial.\nSo they take the name, and they say: \"You can go now. Come back in 3 years. You have a trial.\" This is the United States law, by the way. And made worse by the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is a disaster. Made worse by the Ninth.\nIf you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you're on the other side of what everybody in this room is all about\u2014and, frankly, what most of the people in the country are all about\u2014it's almost like an automatic loss. It's like an automatic loss. They take a case to the Ninth Circuit that's nowhere near the Ninth Circuit, that has nothing to do with the Ninth Circuit.\nSo we're bucking a bad system, and we're bucking a lot of things that are bad. And we're apprehending more people than ever apprehended before. But the laws are really against us, and we're doing well anyway. But we have to do much better. And we can do only better if we have a physical barrier. Because this way we don't have the\u2014even with the bad laws, you have a physical barrier, they can't come on to the\u2014into our country. Mr. Awbrey. If I may, Mr. President, I also\u2014I married into a law enforcement family. Agent Jaime Zapata was the agent killed down in Mexico. You know, it was pretty hard going through that, and I kind of feel you all's pain. Jaime and I were not all that close at first. We gained\u2014you know, became really, really good friends after that. After that happened, I don't know how, but the killers, when they got sent\u2014or went up to DC, they were allowed to bring their entire family and put them up on the taxpayer's dollar. And in front of his parents, just paraded them around. And it was like a stab in the back, you know, for the Government that he gave his life for. And it just\u2014\u2014\nThe President. When was that? How long ago?\nMr. Awbrey. Sir, that was the\u2014that was right out last year when they finally went to sentencing. So\u2014\u2014\nThe President. Convicted?\nMr. Awbrey. Somebody took the fall for it. I can't say that it was the correct person that pulled the trigger.\nThe President. Yes. That's\u2014bad stuff.\nMr. Awbrey. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Pastor, please.\nPastor Ramiro Pe\u00f1a of Christ the King Baptist Church in Waco, TX. Well, thank you, Mr. President, first for coming to Texas and\u2014\u2014\nThe President. Thank you.\nPastor Pe\u00f1a. \u2014\u2014to the Rio Grande Valley. I especially want to thank you for calling this what it is: a humanitarian crisis. When you use that language, it really set bells to ringing, because that is what it is. People in my profession see the suffering, the human suffering, brought by drugs, by the arms that are brought across, making our communities more violent. The trafficking of women and children especially, and boys, and young males as well.\n[Pastor Pe\u00f1a continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nAnd the fact that you called it what it is\u2014it's a crisis and a humanitarian crisis. And again, the pastors that I'm here representing today salute you and thank you for wanting to bring an end to untold suffering that's taking place on our southern border.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you, Pastor. Very nice. Good to see again. Appreciate it.\nPastor Pe\u00f1a. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you.\nCommissioner.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan. Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously, you came to the right part of the border to really bring this border security and humanitarian crisis into focus, number one, for illegal crossings, and number two, for hard narcotics, both between our ports of entry\u2014as you saw from the briefing\u2014and at the ports. And then the humanitarian cost.\n[Commissioner McAleenan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] And so I just wanted to say I'm incredibly proud of the agents, officers, Air Marine professionals that are serving down here, staying focused on the mission despite the challenging environment at this time. I'm very proud of the briefing from Melisa and Carlos, telling you\u2014\u2014\nThe President. Absolutely.\nCommissioner McAleenan. \u2014\u2014with their heart and soul what they do every day to protect our country and our fellow citizens.\n[Commissioner McAleenan continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nAlso, the technology at the ports of entry to stop the drugs, that's a critical element. And very importantly, you asked for humanitarian resources, and we can provide different facilities medical support to get our agents out of the childcare business and help protect families that are crossing and end this violence cycle. It's all controlled by violent criminals in Mexico, primarily transnational criminal organizations. And we want to combat that with these resources.\nSo thank you for the support.\nThe President. Thank you, Commissioner.\nCommissioner McAleenan. We look forward to showing you more on the river.\nThe President. Thank you. A little while. We'll be there in a little while. That's great.\nOne of the things that Dan Patrick suggested, which I thought was very interesting, was give the State of Texas a relatively small amount of money and they'll build a wall themselves, because they want to build it.\nCommissioner McAleenan. That's right.\nThe President. And I thought that was not the worst idea I've ever heard. [Laughter] Although, I still think I could do it cheaper than you. I still think I could do\u2014\u2014\nLt. Gov. Patrick. If you could do it cheap, if you could do it cheaper, we're willing to help you.\nThe President. But I do like the idea, and we're going to look at a couple of ways of doing it where you guys get it up. You do things very well in Texas. And I like that idea. So we'll take a look.\nAnd, Dan, could I ask you to say a few words, please?\nEnforcement and Removal Operations San Antonio Field Office Director Daniel Bible. Yes, Mr. President. I'm Dan Bible. I'm the Field Office Director with ICE ERO for the San Antonio field office. And with the inflow of the immigrants that are coming across in these unprecedented numbers, our officers are\u2014also are coming down to the border to support that effort to deal with the women and children.\n[Director Bible continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nAnd when we look at the family units and stuff that come across in reality, we either just release them right out the door once we take them in, if they're not in a composition that can go into one of our family residential centers. But even if they get to one of our family residential centers, due to some of the legal decisions and stuff, we have 20 days to release them from there. So essentially, they're being just released to the street as well. So pulling our officers away from doing criminal enforcement\u2014\u2014\nThe President. These are the laws. Yeah. Terrible.\nMr. Bible. \u2014\u2014to just basically release family units, it's kind of deteriorating the system and also reducing the secondary\u2014or the secondary\u2014how would you put it?\u2014barrier for them to keep coming, right? I mean, once you get past\u2014if all my agents are at the border doing this, they kind of get a free run in the communities, which make the communities less safe.\nThe President. You're right. And it's not just what's going on at the border. That's really almost a lesser problem. They get through the border and then they filter out throughout the whole country. And you have MS-13 all over Long Island and all over other places. We're getting them out by the thousands. The ICE folks are doing incredibly at getting them out. And they are rough and tough, but the\u2014I will tell you a little secret: ICE is a lot rougher and a lot tougher and a lot smarter. But still, it's a lot of people. A lot of people that they have to get out.\nBut it's not the crime at the border, which has got its own problems; it's what happens once they get through the border and they're dispersed or they disperse themselves throughout the country. And all of that crime is because of it.\nYes, John.\nSen. Cornyn. Mr. President, just before you\u2014before we end tonight, I suspect we'll hear from Secretary Nielsen, who's doing a great job at DHS, but I just want to acknowledge all the local officials here\u2014the mayors and the country judges and others\u2014who supports these men and women who wear the green and blue uniforms.\nThe President. It's great.\nSen. Cornyn. And who basically end up having to try to manage this humanitarian crisis that floods across the border because of the gaps in our law that you've already described.\nAnd you know, we are set up as a country to deal with legal immigration. We applaud legal immigration. But illegal immigration, particularly when it floods over here, we're just not prepared for, especially with these large caravans. And it's created a humanitarian crisis that these men and women, who are local elected officials, have had to deal with.\nSo I wonder if you wouldn't mind if we asked them to stand\u2014\u2014\nThe President. Please. Please.\nSen. Cornyn. \u2014\u2014so we can recognize them and thank them for what they're doing. [Applause]\nThe President. That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you, John, very much.\nSecretary.\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen. Well, sir, I think everyone here today said it so well. What I would tell you is it's not status quo. It is a crisis. It's a humanitarian crisis. It's clearly a security crisis. For those who would like to put their heads in the sand and pretend that it's, quote, unquote, \"manufactured,\" it's not only an insult and deeply disturbing to those that have lost loved ones, but it's an insult to our country, sir. This is a crisis.\n[Secretary Nielsen continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] So I hope today they're watching. I hope they take a cue from you, they decide to be leaders, and they do what this country needs and help us secure it.\nThe President. Well, thank you, Secretary. And you're doing a great job. And you're working hard, I will tell you that. She's working hard. Every time I speak to her, she's in a different location, usually along the border. And, Commissioner, you and the Secretary, and everybody else, we appreciate it very much.\nAnd we're getting there. I think we're making a lot of progress. And I have to say that my sacred duty\u2014most sacred duty as President is to defend the people of our Nation. That's whether it's from foreign nations or along a border. It's all defending our people and defending them properly and strongly and really rightly and justly. And that's what I'm doing.\nAnd it would be a lot easier for me not to do this. It would be a lot easier not to say anything and let this go on. This should have been taken care of 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. It should have been taken care of. I've seen all the speeches made by all the Presidents and a lot people that worked under the Presidents. And you say, \"What happened?\" Nothing happened.\nThey were going to build this wall in 2003, in 2006. They were going to build it 20 years ago. They were going to build it forever. And little sections got built. And I will say, we've done a lot of renovation. And we have a lot of new wall going up where we took down wall because it was in such bad shape, and we put new wall up. We've done a lot of work, but we have work to do.\nSo I hope that the Democrats get together and work on a problem that is truly\u2014it's compassion, it's everything. It's also national security, just like it's a foreign country, it's a foreign world. In many cases, it is a foreign country. We're under attack in a certain way. And we're certainly under attack by criminal gangs, by criminals themselves, by the human traffickers, and by drugs of all kinds. Much of it comes through the southern border.\nAnd if we can do a really great job\u2014and we will\u2014of putting up the barriers, putting up the walls, putting up the fences, putting up everything that we have planned; fixing what's good, but isn't working so well anymore because it's decrepit, it's old, it's torn up from years of abuse and all of the things that happen\u2014we will have done a great service.\nAnd you know, somebody was saying that moving the Embassy to Jerusalem\u2014I got it done. Every President talked about it for many, many years\u2014for decades. They talked about it. They campaigned on it. In every instance, they campaigned on it, they never got it done. Same thing here. Same exact thing. I got that done, and we're going to get this done too.\nAnd this is really the defense of our country. And this is compassion, Pastor, very much so. It's compassion. It's compassion for our people. And we don't want to have situations like Reggie had and his family, where he lost a brother who was special. Or like Marie had with your son who was\u2014I mean, they still talk about your son as being such a great young man. We don't want that. We don't want that.\nSo we're working very hard. We're going to get it done. We are really on the right side of an issue. And I think actually\u2014I know you don't see it yet, but I have feel about things. I think the other side is starting to get it. I may be wrong, but I really believe the other side is starting to understand what's going on. They're on the wrong side of a very important issue. We're going to have it taken care of. I want to thank everybody. And you're right, John, the mayors and all the representatives have done such a great job. And some of you I know. I'm sure I'll get to know the rest of you.\nBut especially, I want to thank Marie and I want to thank Reggie for being here. And I want to thank all of the people\u2014Border Patrol. Brandon, thank you very much. Border Patrol, ICE, and law enforcement for being here. We are with you 1,000 percent. Thank you. Thank you very much.

        "article_texts": "### Tuk-Tuk | touristbangkok | How to get around \u2026\nHow to get around Bangkok by Tuk Tuk\nThe Tuk-Tuk is a worldwide recognized symbol of Thailand with its distinctive design and sound. If you\u2019re a first-time visitor then it\u2019s a must-do to take a spin in one even though you\u2019re breathing in traffic fumes, they\u2019re unstable and you\u2019re probably being overcharged.\nIf you are planning to get around Bangkok by Tuk Tuk, here are the rules. Agree on a price before you get in a Tuk Tuk and make sure the driver understands the destination. It\u2019s usually best to hail a passing Tuk Tuk on the street and not one parked in a tourist area like Khaosan Road. There are no seat belts in a Tuk Tuk. Make sure to hang on tight as it is quite easy to fall or be thrown out if the driver brakes suddenly. Also, keep your bags safe as it is easy for a passing motorcyclist to grab your gear.\nThere are no set Tuk Tuk fares but you shouldn\u2019t really pay more than 60-100 baht to take a short trip such as from\u00a0Khaosan Road\u00a0to the\u00a0Grand Palace,\u00a0Wat Pho\u00a0or destinations around\u00a0Rattanakosin. However, in reality, you\u2019re more likely to end up paying 200 baht to go anywhere. As a general guide try to agree on half of the price that a Tuk Tuk driver quotes you. If there is a group of you it can be quite reasonable if you\u2019re splitting the fare between you.\nTuk-Tuk drivers take part in many of Bangkok\u2019s tourist scams. You should resist any offers of free or cheap tours because this will\u00a0involve you being taken to dodgy gem or tailor\u2019s shops. The price quoted is usually 60 baht for a city tour which will probably involve a promised trip to see the Big Buddha. The tour includes shopping stops where drivers receive a commission if you buy anything. If you don\u2019t buy the driver will often dump you and drive off. The worst drivers tend to hang around Khaosan Road, the Grand Palace & Wat Pho. A Metered Taxi is cheaper, cooler and safer than a Tuk Tuk.\nIf exploring the Old City Rattanakosin area or staying around Khaosan Road, there is good news on the Tuk-Tuk front. A new private hop on \u2013 hop off tuk-tuk on-demand service is offering an unlimited ride ticket operating between 08.30-16.00. Its operation area covers Rattanakosin Island, Dusit & Chinatown. It\u2019s run by the same company that runs the Chao Phraya Tourist Boat & the Tuk-Tuks are honest.\nThe ticket costs 399 baht and discounts are sometimes available if you book online. You can also buy a joint ticket which includes a discounted day pass for the Chao Phraya Express Tourist Boat (valid 09.00-17.30). The joint pass can only be booked here. Also, you can also book a small group guided tuk-tuk tour which visits several tourist attractions in the old city area.\nBook Discounted Tickets Here\nAsian Public Transportation\nJuly, 24\nFind Tickets\nThe joint ticket is only available online. To use Tuk-Tuk Hop you will need to download the free app at the play or apple store. You just call a tuk-tuk via the app and wait for it at a selected location. The only downside is the amount of time you may need to wait for a pick-up. You can book for 15 minutes in advance. If you don\u2019t have WIFI on your phone they can also sell you a sim card & 24-hour WIFI package for 49 baht.\nTouring Bangkok on an organized guided Tuk-Tuk tour is a good choice if you don\u2019t want the hassle of doing it yourself. Tours are available day & at night.\nTaking a Bangkok food tour with a local guide is a great way to get to learn more about Bangkok & taste the local food guided by the recommendations of a local.\nPopular Pages on Tourist Bangkok\nThis site uses cookies to improve your online experience, allow you to share content on social media, measure traffic to this website and display customised ads based on your browsing activity.\n\n### Tuk Tuks in Bangkok - Tuk Tuks\nDiscover Bangkok\u2019s tuk tuks, ride a tuk tuk, rent a tuk tuk\nBangkok is a city renowned for its vibrant tuk tuks.

But local customers are hard to come by these days.\nWith Turkey mired in sky-high inflation, Istanbul's ubiquitous street vendors, who have been part of the cityscape since the Ottoman Empire, are worried about their future.\n\"Our tomorrows are uncertain,\" said Deniz, 18, after pushing his cart past the Rustem Pasha mosque.\nA street vendor sells traditional backery \"Simit\" in the Eminonu district of Istanbul. AFP\n\"I have lost almost half of my customers because of inflation,\" Deniz said as he weighed and handed a bag of chestnuts to an American tourist.\nHe wondered aloud if vendors like him would \"still exist in the future\".\nInflation rose across the world after the Covid pandemic and soared further after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, but it has been particularly bad in Turkey.\nOfficially, it rocketed to 85 percent in October 2022 before slowing and rising again to reach 75 percent in May this year. Inflation has since fallen, with data on Tuesday showing it at 52 percent in August.\nOttoman tradition\nThe streets of Istanbul, a metropolis of 16 million people, would not be the same without its street vendors.\nAt night, mobile stalls with bright neon signs form constellations of light along the picturesque city's streets.\nA street vendor prepares pickle and pickle juices.\nThey fill the air with an array of smells -- from stuffed mussels to simit, rings of delicious sesame-encrusted bread.\nThe merchants enjoy a \"positive image\" in general, said Osman Sirkeci, a researcher at the Izmir University of Economics.\nSome, such as sellers of the sweet toffee paste known as macun, are seen as heirs of an \"Ottoman tradition\", Sirkeci said.\nTheir ranks grew after the Covid pandemic, with one million people becoming street vendors, the researcher said.\nTurkey now counts seven million street vendors, working legally or illegally, he said.\nInflation, however, has hit professions already known for low wages and small margins very hard.\n\"The expenses of mobile merchants are much lower than those of traditional shops because they don't have rent or electricity bills to pay,\" Sirkeci said.\nBut they have other high costs such as raw materials that they get from intermediaries who pass on the cost of inflation, instead of buying them directly from producers.\n\"The price of sesame has skyrocketed. Same for flour. Everything is too expensive,\" said Nuri Geyik, a 54-year-old simit seller.\nA street vendor sells corn as he waits for customers. AFP\nHe used to sell his bread for one lira a piece a few years ago.\n\"Now I'm forced to sell them for 15 lira,\" he said.\nMithat Atilgan sells fruits and vegetables that are grown in Bursa, a region around 150 kilometres (90 miles) south of Istanbul.\n\"The cost of transport has also increased,\" Atilgan said.\n\"Sales are bad,\" he added, noting that Turkish customers cannot keep up with the price increases.\n\"Only the rich can buy my fruits today,\" said Atilgan, who sells figs from his cart.\n-I'm ashamed\nMustafa Demir wondered for how much longer his usual Turkish customers would buy his jars of pickles.\n\"I'm ashamed of selling the jars for 40 liras to my loyal customers,\" he said, recalling how he used to sell them for 15 cents.\nDeniz said his customers were mostly Turkish in the past.\n\"It's not the case anymore. Now 70 percent are tourists,\" Deniz admitted.\nWhile Sirkeci, the researcher, believes that street vendors will survive, Deniz is not so sure.\n\"This job will disappear,\" he said. \"Look at the sellers of boza (a fermented cereal drink). There are almost none of them left in Istanbul.\"\nAgence France-Presse\nWith \u2018The White Lotus\u2019 turning up the heat in Thailand this season, Brits are diving chopsticks-first into fragrant curries.

(RELATED: Does This Photo Show Melania Trump With Porn Actor Ron Jeremy?)\nHowever, there is no record of Trump ever sending such a tweet. A search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets didn\u2019t turn up any matches.\u00a0The Internet Archive also does not show this tweet in captures of the president\u2019s timeline following the rally.\nThe only remotely similar comment that Trump has tweeted in relation to the Tulsa rally came on June 19.\n\u201cAny protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt will be a much different scene!\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the president has been the target of a fake tweet. Earlier in June, social media users shared posts that falsely claimed Trump tweeted that former President Barack Obama left the White House bunker in \u201cbad shape.\u201d Fabricated Trump tweets are often created using websites such as FakeTrumpTweet.com and FakeTweetGenerator.com.",

Nigeria is holding scaled-down celebrations due to high level of insecurity to commemorate over six decades since it gained self-rule from Britain in 1960. (Photo by Kola Sulaimon / AFP)\nSince 1960, when Nigeria became politically independent from the British colonial government, there has never been this level of despondency occasioned by economic hardship, rising poverty, insecurity and other forces widening the national fault lines.\n\u00a0\nIndeed, October 1st anniversary has always come with a fanfare, but this year, the mood is that of a funeral \u2013 the opposite of a country that started with high hopes.\n\u00a0\nThe eerie feeling is not unconnected with dimming hope and near hopelessness nationwide. The Federal Government must have gauged the mood of most Nigerians, when it declared that the independence celebration on Sunday would be low-key, as foreigners will not be invited to commemorate the day with Nigeria.\n\u00a0\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), George Akume, however, said: \u201cLow-key celebration has nothing to do with whether we are not doing well. Economic times are hard; we are looking at it not just at the national level but also as a family.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe theme of the anniversary is: \u2018Nigeria @ 63: Renewed Hope for Unity & Prosperity.\u2019\u00a0But\u00a0there is nothing to celebrate now in Nigeria as the country is\u00a0currently facing an existential crisis.\n\u00a0\nThe dearth of leadership since the collapse of the first republic in January 15, 1966 has given rise to primordial sentiments, clan clashes that gave birth to deadly separatist and terrorist groups that have killed thousands of people and security agents in the country.\n\u00a0\nWhile the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/Eastern Security Network (ESN) are holding the country by the jugular from the Southeastern part of the country,\u00a0Boko Haram\u00a0and bandits have made the northern part of Nigeria unsafe for social and economic activities. Southwest is also grappling with kidnappers that have taken over its forests, making farming almost impossible. So, also is the infrastructural deficit that makes investment in Nigeria less attractive.\n\u2018First-world\u2019 hopes at the beginning\u00a0\u00a0\nMost countries that got their independence at almost the same year as Nigeria have passed the teething economic stages and are ranked among the developed countries in the world, while Nigeria is still crawling at 63.\n\u00a0\nFor instance,\u00a0Nigeria and Singapore were newly independent countries in the early 60s and shared several homogeneous economic statistics as of then. However, Singapore has outperformed Nigeria in economic development, and has earned a first world status. Singapore has a GDP per capita of $93,400 as of 2020, while Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita is $4,900 at the same period.\n\u00a0\nAs at 2021, Nigeria ranked 126 in the Economic Complexity Index (ECI -1.56), and 52 in total exports ($57.7B) while Singapore ranked six and 19 in total exports ($351B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe case of\u00a0Malaysia was also not different.\u00a0Nigeria and Malaysia shared certain features, with high hopes to lead the world. After all, both are plural societies; both experienced colonialism and both are federal and \u201cdemocratic\u201d states. However, unlike Nigeria, Malaysia has been able to tackle not only its cultural and religious differences but also economic challenges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWithin the past three decades, it has deepened its democracy and achieved a significant level of economic development via responsible political leadership, as well as consistent economic planning. Malaysia is now one of the emerging economies in the world with a prospect of joining the league of developed nations in the nearest future.\n\u00a0\nMalaysia has a GDP per capita of $26,400 as of 2020, while Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita is $4,900 at the same period. The Malaysian economy rebounded strongly during 2022, with economic growth momentum boosted by the easing of COVID-19 restrictive measures, and buoyant exports of electrical and electronic products, palm oil products, as well as oil and gas exports whereas Nigeria is battling with many structural issues, including inadequate infrastructure, tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, obstacles to investment, lack of confidence in currency valuation, and limited foreign exchange capacity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nComparing Nigeria with other African countries that got independence almost at the same period, Prof Toyin Falola told\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0that: \u201cIt is even more difficult to accept the present reality if we look at the situation considering the state of other nations which gained an independent head start with the giant of Africa. I must admit that quantitative assessment of realities is not the preoccupation of the historian; hence, I will refrain from attempting such painstaking particularisation of woes. But the truth is that if Nigeria had been on a journey to bliss, the drivers, at some point, must have indulged in some frivolous detours at the expense of the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe renowned international scholar noted that \u201cIt becomes even sadder when we realise that other countries like Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, and South Africa, who became independent about the same time or much later, have taken flight, leaving the giant behind. The question beckons: if it took six decades to arrive at this abyss, how much determination and sacrifice do we need to get the nation back on track? It is my humble opinion that the nation is not the problem. The drivers of the nation are.\u201d\nAnd the fault lines are widening\nHowever, the removal of fuel subsidy has further increased inflation and hardship in Nigeria without corresponding palliatives from both the federal and state governments. Besides, the recent hike in the price of diesel from about N750 per litre to N1,100 per/litre may force many companies out of business and increase unemployment rate.\n\u00a0\nApart from parlous state of the economy that will prevent most Nigerians from celebrating Independence Day on Sunday, the outcome of the 2023 general election has further polarised Nigerians along ethnic lines, causing serious setbacks in efforts to build a nation-state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nA former Emir of Kano, Muhammed Sanusi, regretted that the last election has, \u201cdangerously divided Nigeria along ethnic and religious lines.\u201d\u00a0He said:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think Nigeria has been in a place as difficult as this since the civil war. We have a challenge of nation-building. We have a country that has been divided dangerously along ethnic and religious lines. We have an economy that is in the doldrums, and unfortunately, we seem to be having a dearth of leadership.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut a Social Entrepreneur and Public Affairs Analyst, Chukwuma Okenwa, while agreeing that the 2023 general elections have thrown more divisions in the country, blamed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for jettisoning its own rules.\n\u00a0\nHe stated that for the first time in a long while, Nigerians decided to vote to make things right for themselves, stressing, however, that the confidence they reposed on the electoral body was dashed when merit was thrown to the wind in preference for the highest bidder.\u00a0He said: \u201cOne interesting thing that arose out of the election, especially the presidential election was the fact that it gave each region the opportunity to present her very first. Now, you saw discussions that were tailored towards religious and ethnic lines and the desire would have been that the electoral umpire should use its rules and regulations to ensure that the candidate with the highest votes and more receptive to the people wins the process. It never happened.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor such an election for the very first time in Nigeria, we are having across the nation litigation numbering about 500 cases. You had almost all the parties contending that a lot went wrong and didn\u2019t go the right way. What it means is that the sacrifice that was put up for a better way of doing things had been thrown to the dust.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOkenwa continued: \u201cAnother thing about the process is that we now see the responsibility of INEC, which includes the conduct of election, declaration of results, and winner now being shifted to the court. As we see in other democracies across the world where after an election, the winner congratulates the loser; we didn\u2019t see that happening in the last election.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, the division is also not being able to manage the sensitivities that have lived with us for several years, which the Federal Character Commission has not been able to manage, but to now deepen it such that it has become glaring that certain people should not be near power and what have you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOn the way out, he stated that Nigerians are seriously looking at the judiciary to remedy the situation by taking holistic review of the elections, adding that should they uphold, the presidential election will mean additional responsibility of the administration to manage the country\u2019s sensibilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHe insisted that whatever action being made by institutions of the country should be tailored towards the sustenance of unity and the constitution of the land.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSpokesperson of the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Campaign Council, Dr TankoYunusa, blamed greed, and the premium placed on the pursuit of the primordial sentiments of tribe and religion as the bane of the country\u2019s development.\n\u00a0\nYunusa maintained that Nigeria would remain on its knees if the ruling elite sustained the ugly trends. In a chat with\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0ahead of the 63 Independence anniversary of the country, he noted: \u201cThe truth is that Nigeria is a great nation. We have a lot that would have made us better as a collective and prosperous country.\u00a0Our leaders started in the right direction, but unfortunately, they allowed tribal and religious sentiments to cloud their sense of collective judgment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAnd that is exactly where we started getting it wrong. And then to institutionalise it when individuals started thinking about themselves and not about the country and the people themselves exacerbated the matter more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen we now have greedy politicians who are not thinking about the country as a united entity, but their interest is about power and what they can grab for themselves alone. They forget that if they make the country better and the country is united and is doing well everybody will benefit. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t think in that direction. Everything is now falling to pieces.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHowever, an elder statesman, Malam Tanko Yakassai, insisted that the country is on course towards achieving the desired growth despite the setbacks it recorded over the years.\nAccording to him: \u201cThe most important thing is that we have now gained independence, we are no longer a dependent country. We are on our own. It\u2019s just like a slave you set free; once he is free he is free forever.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNow in the course of life, you have challenges. Sometimes you overcome them, some other times you struggle hard before you overcome them. But, whatever happens, they are processes of progress.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you overcome problems, it\u2019s a development. Even if you did not succeed you are gaining experience because the next time you know what to do to solve that problem. This is what we are doing presently, which is the significance of independence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are now in control of our destiny. This is the process even the most advanced countries like the United Kingdom (UK) and America have all gone through. Today we are the managers of our own affairs, which was the driving force behind our agitation for independence.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPresident of Ijaw National Congress (INC), Prof. Benjamin Okaba, said to achieve national unity and cohesion: \u201cThe first thing is to guarantee justice, equity and fair play in accordance with the dreams of the founding fathers of the country, who gave us our own indigenous constitution that had respect for our unity in diversity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe recalled that in that same constitution, we had a country where our individual challenges were not allowed to derail, but foster development, lamenting the current situation where Nigeria has become secondary to individual and ethno-religious affiliations.\n\u00a0\nHe called for restructuring of the country, especially its politics, and a return to regionalism, which enabled the different regions to develop at their own pace and foster competition, rather than rivalry, and each region, was able to control and exploit natural resources in its domain and derivation formula was 50 per cent.\n\u00a0\nOkaba stressed that with the failings of the federal system of government, as being practiced in Nigeria today, there is a need for restructuring, saying what the country needs today is a confederation, where the federating component units will have some level of autonomy, with the centre being less attractive, as was the case in the First Republic.\n\u00a0\nThe university don lamented that today, individual and ethnic affiliation has taken precedence over national interest and patriotism.\nThe way forward\n\u00a0Speaking on how to build a nation-state where all ethnic nationalities will interact without mutual distrust, spokesman of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Dr. Ken Robinson, stated that it will require multi-layer efforts, involving the government, opinion moulders, women leaders, traditional rulers, politicians, and stakeholders at various levels to do their bids, in terms of their actions and utterances.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGovernment needs to show inclusiveness. It must show that it is concerned about inclusive governance and open to inputs from all corners and sections of the country.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur traditional rulers must play their role, in terms of trying to bring their people together and moderate the utterances and actions of the people in various parts of the country.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPolitical and community leaders have to mind the things they say and do, so that the country can remain cohesive and united,\u201d he said.\nFOREMOST lawyer and founder Afe Babalola University (ABUAD) Ado Ekiti, Aare Afe Babalola SAN said: \u201cIt is a notorious fact that the fabrics of the Nigerian nation is currently so badly fragmented that putting it back on the right path is as complex as trying to turn fish soup back to fish.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith unprecedented levels of poverty, insecurity, economic instability, impoverishment, energy poverty, environmental degradation and lamentable standard of living across the width and breath of the country, the founding visions of Nigeria have been badly mutilated, defaced, and chipped away. More than ever, the gaps between the different regions that make up Nigeria are real, wide-ranging, and pronounced. The ideals of Nigerian nationhood have been eroded, while the dreams of nationalism and patriotism are at the lowest ebb in the country.\n\u00a0\nHe noted that the country is currently at a monumental crossroads that will require radical transformations in the conceptualisation, functionality, and organisation of the Nigerian nation to guarantee a united, peaceful, and progressive future for the country.\n\u00a0\nThe Nonagenarian who has been advocating for true federalism said that, \u201cNigeria and its people must face the reality. We cannot continue to ignore or downplay the fierce and urgent realities of Nigeria\u2019s dire circumstances. Most recently, a new United Nations report described Nigeria as a \u2018pressure cooker of internal conflict\u2019, warning that the country\u2019s multiple security problems could soon lead to continental crises.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAccording to the United Nations, the level of poverty, hunger, insecurity, mass killings, extremisms, police brutality, deprivation, public fear, lack of public trust and confidence in the state institutions, and wanton disregard for the rule of law currently witnessed in Nigeria has reached extreme, monumental and unprecedented proportions.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\nProviding solutions to how the country can return to the path of greatness, Afe Babalola said. \u201cAll concerned Nigerians must acknowledge the flashing bright red warning lights and begin to ask tough questions on how to draw the country out of its doldrums. Without doing so, the country called Nigeria may be facing a tipping point that no one could predict its ultimate result.\n\u201cThe next question then is what can be urgently done to avert the entrenched existential crises facing the Nigerian nation? In my view, Nigeria currently faces only two tough options: restructure or reconfigure. In political terms, restructuring refers to a complete overhaul of a nation\u2019s political system to make it operate more effectively. This could be in the form of adopting a new constitution, new economic model, decentralisation of powers, as well as devolution of powers to the constituent units. To restructure is to change an existing status quo to make it more functional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor Prof Falola, who also blamed the Nigerian leaders for the socio-economic and political crises in the country, he said: \u201cMore than anything, independence symbolises freedom from hegemony. Yet it also presents a situation where the\u00a0Independent\u00a0bears the burden of responsibility on its shoulders. In the case of Nigeria, just like every other African state, independence presented both the cross and the crown. Success in the ensuing eras lies solely on the ability of the beneficiaries and progenies of such bequest of power to carry the cross as graciously as they adorn the crown. It is needless to say that Nigerian leaders chose to adorn the crown while avoiding the agonies of the cross. I must admit that wearing the crown while bearing the cross is only the stuff of messiahs, not politicians.\u201d\nShare :\nRutam House, Plot 103/109, Apapa-Oshodi Express Way, Isolo, P.M.B 1217 Oshodi, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\u00a9 2025 GUARDIAN NEWSPAPERS.

The plunge from the bridge is also a traditional rite of passage for local youths.\nDivers wait to jump from Mostar bridge during 454th traditional diving competition.\nCREDIT:\nGETTY IMAGES\nLorens Listo, organiser of the diving competition and a 13-time winner, said the number of competitors had not dropped significantly because many people were \"craving\" to compete.\n\"But the audience shrunk and there are no tourists in the city,\" he said, pointing to empty streets that in previous years were packed with thousands of tourists who flocked to the town to watch the contest.\nUnder measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, only 100 people were allowed to watch the contest, from a fenced platform just bellow the white bridge which arches over the Neretva River.\nA man jumps from Mostar bridge during 454th traditional diving competition in Mostar.\nCREDIT:\nGETTY IMAGES\nA few hundred more spectators watched from further away, observing social-distancing guidelines.\nAfter a strict lockdown, Bosnia has seen a spike in infections since the easing of restrictions at the end of June and the reopening of borders with neighbouring countries.\nOn Sunday, Bosnia reported 10,334 cases of the coronavirus, of these nearly 5,000 in the past three weeks, and 287 deaths.\nHarun Bojagoric, 17, a native of Mostar, was among 32 competitors in the diving contest.

Jumping into its chilly water has been taking place from the 27-meter-high bridge for most of that time.\nAt the end of next month the most prepared and bravest divers will assemble in Mostar for a unique competition just as they have done for the past 455 years.\nDaring dives from the Stari Most (Old Bridge), the symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina, belong to one of the oldest traditions in Europe \u2013 one which has not been interrupted by wars, invaders, pandemics, nor adverse weather conditions. People dived from the remains of the bridge even when it was demolished in the 90s.\nTraditionally it has been a male right of passage in Mostar, with a dive from the bridge marking the moment when a boy becomes a man. But the modern Red Bull diving competition that also uses the bridge demonstrates that women are just as capable at performing this incredible feat.\nThe importance that locals attach to these dives is underlined by Lorens Listo, one of the most successful divers of all time.\n\u201cIn Mostar, there was always an unwritten rule that the one who didn\u2019t dive from the Old Bridge is not a real Mostarian,\u201d says Listo, who has won a total of 13 first places in head dives. He performed his first competitive dive from a bridge at the age of 19. In 2019, he equalled the previous record holder Emir Bali\u0107 and decided to stop competing in order not to overtake his role model.\nFor divers, a dive is an incredible feeling, full of adrenaline and excitement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a dive, it\u2019s a flight\u201d, says Listo. \u201cYou fly in the air. The flight lasts approximately three seconds and the diver falls at a speed of over one hundred kilometres per hour at an angle of 45 degrees. The impact in the water is incredibly strong.\u201d\n\u201cYour whole life stops in those three seconds\u201d, says Evlad Krnji\u0107, a competitor from Montenegro and last year\u2019s winner in head diving, succinctly describing the moment of flight towards the water.\n\u201cI got goosebumps when you asked me what the dive looked like and I relived it now. It cannot be described in words. That adrenaline, courage and pride. You fascinate whole crowd of people, you feel proud, and that impresses every man,\u201d says Krnji\u0107, who trained on the Cijevna River in Tuzi in Montenegro, and his father and mother are also divers.\nIt is extremely important to overcome the fear of heights and injuries because this is the key to a successful dive.\nCliff diving from the Old Bridge is extremely dangerous and injuries are common, no matter how trained and careful the competitors are. People have been killed.\n\u201cThe impact of hitting the water is huge because the speed of the diver is high,\u201d says Listo. \u201cWhen the diver falls into the water, it\u2019s literally an explosion. In my twenty years of competition, I broke my arms, fingers, ribs, collarbone, coughed up blood, my capillaries burst.\u201d\nEvlad says: \u201cThe most important thing is to clear your mind before diving. I prepare more mentally than physically. It is important to overcome fear, which always exists, but also to maintain self-confidence.\u201d\nIn summer, the air temperature in Mostar rises to 45 degrees, and the Neretva River is much colder, around 12 degrees Celsius, so even that temperature difference is a challenge and the body experiences a big shock.\nDuring the year, divers spend a lot of time in the gym where they try to gain muscle mass in order to reduce the chances of injury. When the days start getting warmer, they jump from different heights in order to better prepare for the competition.\nPreparation and training for dives is done at lower heights on diving boards because jumping from the Old Bridge is so high and risky. It is only just before the competition, that competitors dive a few times from the bridge in order to get the best possible feeling and so that the performance of their dive is perfect.\nAnd in the final few days before the competition, they save their bodies by not diving in order to make their performance as good as possible.\nIn the last week of July, when the competition is held, Mostar becomes a mecca for divers from the entire region, as well as numerous tourists and media who follow the dives. Divers compete in two disciplines: feet first dive and headfirst dive \u2013 the traditional \u201dMostar swallow\u201c, which is a much more demanding dive and unique in the world.\nThe divers remember that after the war, a former peacekeeper from Great Britain competed with them, but he gave up after the first dive, realising how risky it was. The competition normally takes place in two rounds, and the expert jury evaluates the dives by carefully following each diver\u2019s move. The diver must not show fear or nervousness, the takeoff must be as good as possible, special attention is paid to the position in the air, and the type of entry in the water.\nThe Old Bridge in Mostar was built between 1557 and 1566 during the Ottoman rule in this part of Europe and is a unique architectural monument that attracts an increasing number of tourists. It is a national monument for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and since 2005 has been on the Unesco list of protected world heritage sites.\nOne of the most difficult and saddest moments in the lives of Mostarians took place in November 1993 when the Old Bridge was demolished during shelling in the war. Fortunately for everyone, it was renovated in 2004 and has become an attraction for thousands of tourists, as well as divers who dream of winning the prestigious annual competition.\nImpartial news + intelligent debate\nAll rights reserved. \u00a9 2025 Associated Newspapers Limited.",

They had an appointment in a few short days to request asylum in the United States through the CBP One application, until Donald Trump shut down the system in the first few minutes of his presidency. The action has left thousands of migrants stranded in Mexican territory with no chance of seeking shelter on the other side of the border. Sol and Dayane waited nearly a year for the platform to confirm their appointment. Meanwhile, they cleaned, worked at a printing company and sold candy. They never begged to survive, they insist. The appointment was their reward. For Sol, it was also the chance to reunite with her underage children, who are on the other side of the wall. But from one moment to the next, the future was shattered for thousands of people.\nTrump cast migrants as the enemy during his campaign. He has threatened to deport millions and shut down all options of applying for humanitarian visas. At the border, they knew all this would happen, but no one thought it would be so soon. CBP granted 1,450 appointments a day at eight border crossings, from Tijuana to Matamoros. Since the system was installed in 2023, one million migrants had been able to apply for asylum and legally enter the United States. As a result, irregular crossings had plummeted.\nNow, as Rodolfo Rubio, researcher at the College of Chihuahua, explains, the elimination of CBP One has left migrants with very few options. The new president has announced that he will bring back the Migrant Protection Protocols program, also known as Remain in Mexico, so that the migrants can wait in Mexico while their applications are processed on the other side of the border. This is slower and more dangerous, and Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has yet to issue its approval of the plan. \u201cThe final scenario is that they end up being a very important market for traffickers of undocumented immigrants. This measure benefits crime,\u201d says Rubio.\nIn such a panorama of uncertainty and helplessness, EL PA\u00cdS is sharing the stories of those who came so close to a new life.\nJesy Palmera enters the soup kitchen run by a religious organization slowly, with caution. He apologizes for his stained hands. He works as a mechanic and managed to get away for a break. He has a January 27 appointment with his brother John to request asylum in the United States and has seen on social media that something has happened to the application, though they have yet to receive any email. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for guidance,\u201d he says. They receive confirmation that all appointments have been canceled with profound sadness. They explain that 10 months have passed since they left Portuguesa, Venezuela \u201cwith a suitcase, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe Palmera brothers made the journey to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap and seven countries like everyone who has no money does: on foot. \u201cWe only stopped to work, just for the time that was necessary, without losing days,\u201d says 26-year-old John, who is an agricultural engineer but has had to find work in construction and selling furniture. This is how they have been able to stay in Ju\u00e1rez for the last month, and how they imagine they will manage going forward: \u201cWe will have to be patient and wait for this man to soften his heart.\u201d\nAmid doubts and fear, the Palmera brothers know one thing for sure: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go there de mojado [without papers]. If that\u2019s how it is, I\u2019m going back,\u201d says John. 31-year-old Jesy adds, \u201cI\u2019m a humble and poor man. I\u2019m healthy, thank God. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for me to enter the country that way, because the only good thing I have in this world is my resume and I wouldn\u2019t want to damage it.\u201d\nMargelis Tinoco fell to the ground as cameras captured the desperate look on her face. She had just read the notification that the appointment she had to request asylum that very day had been canceled. She held up her confirmation, which she had printed out in color, sobbed hopelessly and then fell silent. There were no words. Along with her husband Jos\u00e9 Loaiza and their 13-year-old son Josu\u00e9, she\u2019d arrived early to the El Paso Norte border crossing that connects Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso. Their asylum interview had been scheduled to take place three hours after Trump became president. They didn\u2019t have long to wait. As the new president was still giving his inaugural speech, the application was taken down. \u201cThey had us out here shivering since four in the morning, lined up, saying they were going to get us through, and in the end, nothing. You can\u2019t play with a person like that, it\u2019s not humane,\u201d says Loaiza.\nNine years ago, the family left Zulia, on the Venezuelan coast. They worked in the fishing industry, but the country\u2019s economic problems had left them with nearly nothing. They crossed the border to Tib\u00fa, Colombia, where they settled down, but the murder of their eldest son displaced them once again, and this time, they went to Bogot\u00e1: \u201cWe are victims of armed conflict,\u201d says Loaiza. The threats and harassment continued even after the family reached the Colombian capital and, this time numbering one less, they had to set out again.\nOnce in Mexico, they waited in a Mexico City shelter for their CBP One appointment to be confirmed. They had only recently arrived in Ju\u00e1rez. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anyone here,\u201d says Loaiza. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go, because it could be that these people\u2019s hearts take pity on us. There were only a few of us in line, look, there were about 20 of us. I told the guard to let us go through to our appointment, quickly. But he told me that it was no longer possible.\u201d Just a few hours marked the difference between one future and another.\nCaridad Hern\u00e1ndez didn\u2019t expect Trump\u2019s arrival would interrupt her plans so quickly. \u201cI thought that they would at least respect the appointments that had already been approved and that we would be able to cross,\u201d says the 61-year-old Cuban, who is with her 58-year-old spouse Jorge Ramos, a jovial man who hides behind his sunglasses. The two made the decision nine months ago to sell everything they had in Cuba and set off, like so many before them, on the journey to the United States. They flew to Nicaragua and from there, hired a coyote who helped them cross Central America, and then Mexico. Hern\u00e1ndez says they spent $40,000 on the journey. They brought with them their 17-year-old granddaughter Alenays.\nThe confirmation of their application arrived on January 2, and they were happy. At last, they\u2019d be able to travel north to where the girl\u2019s father lives in Texas. The Cuban family says they stopped for a period in the State of Mexico to work and save a little bit of money. They had to leave everything behind to get to the border. \u201cWe\u2019ve been left without an appointment, without rent, without work, without anything,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cPractically how we arrived on this Earth,\u201d responds her husband. Like hundreds of others, the Cubans are stuck at the border. They can\u2019t cross, but neither can they return to the country\u2019s central region.\nThe CBP One appointment had opened a door for them, but now, they would have to start the application to qualify as refugees in Mexico. It was the last option open to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to Cuba, there\u2019s nothing left for us there and it\u2019s possible that we would face political reprisals for leaving,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cYou know what hurts me the most? That we always wanted to do things legally, in the best way possible. We never wanted to enter illegally,\u201d she says. Hern\u00e1ndez and Ramos have a couple of suitcases and some bags with them, the only possessions they have left. Sad and disoriented, they try to cheer each other up in the face of this new situation. \u201cWe have to keep fighting. In the end, we are alive, which is the important thing,\u201d says Ramos. \u201cOnly the Lord knows what is going to happen,\u201d says his wife.\nCarlos Andr\u00e9s and Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles have been together for 15 years and have three children. Their kids, they say, are in Colombia. \u201cWe left them being taken care of because we were going to cross first and then when we got there, we were going to send for them,\u201d they say. The couple, who are 31 and 38 years old, had an appointment scheduled for January 27. They explain that migrating to the United States was the only way they could escape death threats. \u201cWe came thinking we could get away from the violence,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s. The journey to Mexico was not much better. They flew from Bogot\u00e1 to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, and from there took a bus to the country\u2019s capital, Mexico City. But at some point along the way, the couple says that agents from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Immigration stole $150 from them. \u201cThey told us that if we didn\u2019t pay them, they wouldn\u2019t let us continue on,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s.\n\u201cAfter Mexico City, we continued our journey up,\u201d continues de los \u00c1ngeles. \u201cWe got on the train, we walked a lot and we lived in the streets, begging for food.\u201d Then they had to flee from authorities. \u201cThey caught us and forced us off the train,\u201d they say. They arrived in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and managed to find work for few months until they received confirmation of their appointment 750 miles away in Tijuana, on the Californian border. At last, after so many calamities, they were within sight of their goal \u2014 until it all came crashing down. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we will do, we\u2019re desperate,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s. \u201cI left my children to try to get in,\u201d says de los \u00c1ngeles.\nThey had permission from Mexican authorities to be in the country until Friday. After that, they didn\u2019t know what they would do. Their time in Mexico has been traumatic and after the decision was made to close the border to immigration, it doesn\u2019t seem like things will change any time soon. \u201cWho wants to stay in a country where they don\u2019t want you? We don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d says de los \u00c1ngeles.\nZoila Romero sold her house in Maracaibo for $2,000 in order to emigrate to the United States. She\u2019s crossed seven countries and has no savings left. She is 51 years old and sits on the sidewalk in front of the El Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana.\nRomero cries disconsolately and hugs her eight-year-old son. She is traveling with her spouse and a group of other Venezuelans they met along the way. On January 20, she awoke to the worst news she could have received: the cancelation of all appointments to request asylum in the United States. Trump\u2019s decision to enforce a hardline immigration policy has left her with no chance of crossing the border, but also no option to return home. She no longer has a house to go back to. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of broken dreams. I had hopes of working and reuniting with my daughters who live in Tennessee,\u201d she says, her eyes full of tears.\nA few hours after the border closure, everything is uncertain. \u201cIf I go back, what can I give my son in Venezuela? I sold everything,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my country, there\u2019s no quality of life, no freedom of expression, we can\u2019t think differently than Maduro.\u201d The woman says she left because she couldn\u2019t make ends meet on her salary. \u201cI earned $2 a month,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat can you do with that? Nothing,\u201d she answers her own question.\nDespite everything, Romero says she maintains hope that they will respect her approved appointment at the border. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, we were very close to achieving our dreams and they shut the door in our face,\u201d she says, wiping away tears. The Venezuelan asks U.S. authorities in general and Trump in particular, \u201cto listen to their hearts,\u201d and let them in. \u201cI understand that they do a background check, but we\u2019ve never done anything bad to anyone. We only want to work and give a better life to our children,\u201d she says. Then she repeats her previous sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nTranslated by Caitlin Donohue.\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripci\u00f3n a la modalidad Premium, as\u00ed podr\u00e1s a\u00f1adir otro usuario.

Agents were making 1,500 arrests a day in April. Last week, they made less than 250 arrests a day.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File)\nATOTONILCO DE TULA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 When Dayana Castro heard that the U.S. asylum appointment she waited over a year for was canceled in an instant, she had no doubt: She was heading north any way she could.\nA Border Patrol agent walks past four men detained after crossing the border illegally in a gap in two walls separating Mexico from the United States before turning themselves in, Thursday, Jan. 23, 2025, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\nThe 25-year-old migrant, her husband and their 4- and 7-year-old children had nothing left at home in Venezuela. They already had trekked the perilous Darien Gap jungle dividing Colombia and Panama and criminal groups that prey on migrants like them.\nCastro was one of tens of thousands of migrants across Mexico with appointments to apply for U.S. asylum at the border scheduled out through February until President Donald Trump took office and issued a series of executive orders to beef up border security and slash migration. One ended the use of the CBP One app that had allowed nearly 1 million people, many seeking asylum, to legally enter the U.S. since January 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep going. We can\u2019t go home after all we\u2019ve been through, after all the countries we\u2019ve fought our way through, only to give up now,\u201d she said from a small shelter in central Mexico beside a freight train line they were riding north.\nMigrants walk into Mexico after being deported from the U.S. at El Chaparral pedestrian border bridge in Tijuana, Mexico, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Felix Marquez)\nNow, migrants like her are adjusting to a new and uncertain reality. Many remain determined to reach the U.S. through more dangerous means, riding freight trains, hiring smugglers and dodging authorities. Some lined up in Mexico\u2019s refugee offices to seek asylum in that country, while others contemplated finding a way back home.\nTrump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops and restrict refugees and asylum, saying he wants to halt illegal entry and border crime. The measures follow a drop in illegal crossings in recent months.\nSupporters of the CBP One app that people like Castro used to try to enter legally say it brought order to a chaotic border. Critics say it was magnet for more people to come.\nMigrants walk through Tapachula, Chiapas state, Mexico, in an attempt to reach the U.S. border, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, the inauguration day of U.S. President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Edgar H. Clemente)\nAdam Isacson, defense oversight analyst for the human rights organization Washington Office on Latin America, said Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration will surely deter migrants in the short term but will also have cascading humanitarian consequences.\nPeople with valid asylum claims may die in their own countries, he said, while migrants fleeing countries like Venezuela, Cuba and Haiti who cannot easily return home may end up floating around the Americas \u201ccompletely unprotected.\u201d Isacson and other analysts expect Trump\u2019s policies will lead to increased demand for smugglers and push migrants \u2014 many of whom are children and families \u2014 to more dangerous terrain to avoid capture.\nBy Tuesday, Castro was wrapping her mind around the fact that continuing on after her Feb. 18 appointment with U.S. authorities was canceled would likely mean putting her life, and the lives of her family, at risk as cartels are increasingly extorting and kidnapping vulnerable migrants.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the train, the cartels, migration police, and they all make you pay them,\u201d she said as she fed her children bread beside a small shelter where they slept. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t put ourselves at risk, we\u2019ll never arrive.\u201d\nAlong Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala another group of migrants in Tapachula took a different approach.\nCuban migrant Rosal\u00ed Mart\u00ednez waited in line outside the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid in the sweltering southern city. Traveling with her child, she had hoped to reunite with her husband in the U.S.\nMigrants line up to board boats to continue their journey north hoping to reach the United States after walking across the Darien Gap from Colombia in Bajo Chiquito, Panama, Nov. 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File)\nNow, she was biding her time, joining an increasing number of migrants who have sought asylum in Mexico in recent years, either temporarily due to shifting American restrictions or more permanently.\nLike many Cubans in recent years, Mart\u00ednez was fleeing a spiraling economic crisis.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here and see what happens,\u201d she said. But \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Cuba. I\u2019ll become a Mexican citizen, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back to Cuba.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s recent moves have also forced people to make even more drastic moves and seek to return to their countries without clear pathway or resources to do so, according to Enrique Vidal Olascoaga, director of the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova human rights center in Tapachula.\n\u201cIt\u2019s had a powerful deterrent effect,\u201d he said. \u201cSeveral people are hesitating about what they\u2019re going to do from this point forward and are openly asking if there are ways or services to return.\u201d\nJomaris Figuera, 42, and her husband were among those who wanted to throw in the towel after years trying to build a life outside Venezuela, where economic and political crises have prompted nearly 8 million people to flee in recent years.\nWorkers begin the installation of a temporary shelter for possible deportees from the United States, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Christian Chavez)\nThey spent more than four years picking coffee in neighboring Colombia, but struggling to make ends meet, they decided to traverse the Darien Gap. They waited nearly a year and a half for a legal pathway to the U.S. in a wooden shelter in a crime-riddled migrant camp in the center of Mexico City.\nBut due to Venezuela\u2019s crises, they have no passports. And without money, they fear their only pathway back will be traveling south through Mexico and Central America, and walking days through the same rugged mountains of the Darien Gap.\nAnything would be better than staying in Mexico, said Figuera.\nColombian migrant Margelis Tinoco, 48, cries after her CBP One appointment was canceled at the Paso del Norte international bridge in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on the border with the U.S., Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, the inauguration day of President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Christian Chavez)\n\u201cIt\u2019s like abandoning everything after everything that\u2019s happened to us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after trying to get an appointment, and this happens, we\u2019ve given up.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAP reporter Mar\u00eda Verza contributed to this report from Mexico City.

He is set to be inaugurated on Tuesday.\nMartin Fayulu, the runner-up, was contesting the results and demanding a manual recount. The judges of the constitutional court said they had determined that the request for a recount was \u201cabsurd\u201d and that Mr. Fayulu had not provided any proof of fraud.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMr. Fayulu said early Sunday that the court has \u201cfalsified and countered the truth of the polls to serve an unjust cause and perpetuate a regime that our people hate.\u201d\n\u201cI now consider myself the only legitimate president,\u201d he added.\nCongo went to the polls in December in what was intended to be the country\u2019s first democratic handover of power in the 59 years since it gained independence from Belgium. For the past 21 years, the country has been led by the Kabila family, first by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila and then by his son Joseph Kabila.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\nSee subscription options\nMake sense of the day\u2019s news and ideas.\nCatch up on big news, and wind down to end your day.\nThe biggest stories of our time, in 20 minutes a day.\nGet what you need to know to start your day.\nOriginal analysis on the week\u2019s biggest global stories.\nThe latest news for any part of the world you select.\nBackstories and analysis from our Canadian correspondents.\nThe most crucial business and policy news you need to know.\nOur best tech reporting from the week.\nOur tech journalists help you make sense of the rapidly changing tech world.\nReviews, news and features to help you find your next read.\nStreaming TV and movie recommendations.\nThe podcast that takes you inside the literary world.\nPop music news, new songs and albums, and artists of note.\nUnwind with stories about culture and the way we live.\nEssential news and guidance to live your healthiest life.\nThe complicated love lives of real people.\nMapping the new world order through interviews and conversations.\nYou've heard the news, here's what to make of it.\nDiscussions of ideas that matter, plus book recommendations.\nPodcasts and narrated articles covering news, tech, culture and more.Go to Audio\nCome on in, the culture's fine.\nYour morning listen.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\nThe video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram:\nThe video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers.\nAs the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here.) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers.\n5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment (false); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns (false, they are actually investing more in the technology.)\nIn this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true, the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation).\nAlthough China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019. South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany?\nFurthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nCOVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\nAs for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong.\nHere's the original video from the Guardian:\nThe Guardian reported:\nActivists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data.\nIn short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.\nCooper, Daniel. \u00a0 \"No, 5G Didn't Start a Pandemic.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Engadget. \u00a0 19 March 2020.\nHorowitz, Jeremy. \u00a0 \"The U.S. Now Has 4 Live 5G Networks, But Good Luck Actually Using Them.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Venture Beat. \u00a0 1 July 2019.\nLi, Kenneth; Park, Ju-Min. \u00a0 \"Who Was First to Launch 5G?

A video from the protest is circulating on social media nearly three years later, in May 2022, with the false suggestion that it is current. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\nCLAIM: Video shows people in Hong Kong \u201crebelling against the COVID police state by cutting down and destroying security cameras.\u201d\nAP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. Despite suggestions that the video is current, it shows protesters downing a \u201csmart lamppost\u201d in August 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTHE FACTS: The video, taken nearly three years ago, is circulating once again with the false implication that it shows recent events. It shows protesters holding umbrellas while pulling down a lamppost.\n\u201cHong Kong: people are cutting down facial recognition towers,\u201d a widely shared tweet of the video reads.\nAnother tweet sharing the video claims: \u201cHong Kong is rebelling against the COVID police state by cutting down and destroying security cameras.\u201d\nBut footage of the same events can be seen in 2019 social media posts and in a still image captured by The Associated Press on Aug. 24, 2019.\nAs the AP reported that day, protesters took to the streets to demand the removal of the lampposts over worries that they could contain high-tech cameras and facial recognition software used for surveillance by Chinese authorities.\nThe same video was misrepresented in 2020 posts that claimed the protesters were tearing down a 5G pole, implying China \u201cfound the cure\u201d to the coronavirus. It was filmed near a large shopping mall in Hong Kong called MegaBox.\nIn Hong Kong, the rising costs of China\u2019s strict \u201czero COVID\u201d strategy have sparked a backlash, the AP reported. Hong Kong reopened beaches and pools and relaxed other pandemic restrictions on Thursday.\n___\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Thirteen million refugees have fled the conflict that has ravaged Syria for the last eight years.\nSome in the West have expressed concerns that Syrian religious extremists may migrate to the West under cover of the refugee crisis to do harm.\nThat attitude was reflected by presidential candidate Donald Trump in a Tweet from Nov. 17, 2015.\n\u201cRefugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country,\u201d then presidential candidate Trump tweeted. \u201cWho knows who they are \u2013 some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\u201d\nTrump\u2019s fear of Syrian refugees has been echoed in Europe.\nA Pew Research Center study in 2016 found that 59% of European respondents believed that the coming of refugees would increase the likelihood of terrorism in their country.\nSo Syrian refugees are now marooned in refugee camps or other temporary venues, unable to migrate because of immigration policies borne, in part, of these fears.\nTrump has essentially closed the borders to Syrians, with only 41 refugees admitted to the U.S. in 2018.\nNumbers admitted were also down in Europe, previously the top destination for Syrian refugees.\nWe aimed to find out, through our survey, whether Syrian refugees pose a danger to the West.\nFear of refugees may, to at least some degree, be psychological. Social scientists and philosophers have long noted people\u2019s aversion to otherness of any kind, and the ubiquitous tendency to scapegoat and persecute minorities that differed from one\u2019s own group in race, ethnicity or religion.\nThat fear has been cleverly exploited by politicians fueling anti-immigrant populism that catapulted xenophobic agendas to the forefront of national politics in various parts of the world, including Europe and the U.S.\nPsychology\u2019s ability to explain the pervasive fear of Syrian refugees does not necessarily mean that such fear is completely unfounded. Yet there are currently hardly any data about Syrian refugees\u2019 state of mind, and on their interest (or lack thereof) in ideological and political causes of various kinds.\nTo address this gap in knowledge we carried out extensive surveys over the period between 2016 and 2017 with Syrian refugees temporarily living in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. We asked about their motivations, ideological commitments and immigration intentions. These data have been analyzed only now, and this is the first glimpse at our findings.\nWe wanted to know whether their political radicalism, if any, and their readiness to make sacrifices for religious and political causes would be related to their intention to immigrate to the West.\nOur study contradicts the idea that Syrian refugees are a danger to the countries to which they\u2019ve immigrated.\nWe found that the majority of refugees wished to return to their home countries. And the overall level of radical religious and political beliefs among refugees was low.\nOur study finds, moreover, that refugees inclined to move westward are typically pro-Western to begin with.\nWere our respondents telling us the truth?\nWe believe so. Here\u2019s why.\nFirst, we took precautions to have our data collection carried out by Arabic speaking researchers from the region familiar with our respondents\u2019 culture. They had credibility with the participants that outsiders would lack and so were less likely to cause respondents to dissimulate their feelings and opinions.\nSecond, we stressed to the respondents that their identity will remain private, which would make them feel more safe in giving honest answers.\nFinally, our subsequent focus groups with Syrian refugees already in the West confirmed our survey results.\nFor the most part, these refugees saw the West as a land of stability, security and economic opportunity. Those expectations, rather than a desire to inflict harm, determined the refugees\u2019 relocation intentions, our data suggests.\nOne refugee that we interviewed in Germany described her expectations prior to leaving for the West: \u201cI heard people talk about how things will be easy and how we will be welcomed and they will arrange us houses, monthly salary and help us finding jobs just like in USA.\u201d\nStrikingly, in all our samples, radically leaning respondents decidedly preferred to go home rather than migrate to the West. Their reluctance to go West was highly correlated with their perception that neither their basic needs for security and comfort nor their significance needs for respect and status are likely to be met there.\nThese individuals were not big fans of the West, and felt uncomfortable with the prospect of spending their life there.\nContrary to the fear that the refugees\u2019 intentions are to pour westward and potentially stir things up, our survey showed that refugees with extreme religious and political views were among the least likely to want to move West and among the most likely to want to return to heir homeland and pursue their ideological ends there.\nThe concerns of refugees who wanted to relocate to the West were largely personal and pragmatic.\nTheir motivation to immigrate to the West was driven by hopes that it is the place where their basic needs for security and subsistence and their significance needs for status and respect would be met. Those expectations of fulfillment and satisfaction in the West, our data suggest, determined the refugees\u2019 relocation intentions.\nFrom the results of our survey, the danger that the West will be flooded by Syrian radicals appears grossly exaggerated. Instead, refugees inclined to move westward are typically pro-Western to begin with.\nThese results are subject to two caveats. First, our data attests to general trends only. Careful vetting of all refugees is still essential for any country.\nSecond, a great deal might depend on the welcome refugees receive from the host community. A hostile and discriminatory attitude might produce frustration and radicalize refugees.\nThe latter scenario, however, rests firmly in the hands of the countries that offer them refuge.\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132025, The Conversation\n\n### Vox, Spain\u2019s hard-right party, explained\nIn a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.

The Partido Popular is expected to attempt to find enough support to form a government. A coalition government between the center left, left, and separatist parties may be more realistic, however.

Domestically, it would mean that Vox, the country\u2019s hard-right party, could help influence policy, advancing harsh attacks on LGBTQ people, women, and migrants. Broadly, it would also send a message outside Spanish borders, adding to the victories of the far right in places like Greece, Finland, and Italy in the last year.\nEver since the demise of the ultranationalist dictatorship of Francisco Franco in the 1970s, Spanish voters have been hesitant\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.\nNATO countries will buy weapons from the US \u2014 and deliver them to Ukraine.\nThe end of mandatory shoe removal signals progress on airport security.\n\u201cMowing the grass\u201d didn\u2019t stop October 7.

Erika Jar\u00e1iz Gul\u00edas from the University of Santiago de Compostelan reports\nI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice\nSpain has shown relative resistance to the rising far-right tide, and it is currently one of Europe\u2019s only left-wing governed countries. Historically, attempts to create relevant far-right parties in Spain have been unsuccessful, though in the last decade the far-right party Vox has risen to become the third or fourth force in the Spanish party system.\nVox\u2019s populist stance is primarily built on the defence of traditional values and Spanish national identity, and opposition to all forms of regional autonomy. However, even at a time when it has the potential to enter national government by propping up a coalition with the conservative People\u2019s Party (PP), its approach has been unconventional.\nThe 2023 regional elections brought PP-Vox coalitions to power in 6 of the country\u2019s 17 regional parliaments, but Vox made headlines when it quit all of these positions in July last year. Their alleged motive: the PP\u2019s decision to support the central government in bringing 400 unaccompanied minors from the Canary Islands to the mainland.\nWhile this may seem disproportionate, it forms part of Vox\u2019s wider strategy to split the right and establish their own voter base to the right of the PP.\nThere are three elements that explain why Spain\u2019s extreme right has taken so long to enter the political mainstream, and why, unlike many of its European counterparts, Vox has not, as yet, been able to enter national government in Spain.\nUntil just a few years ago, the PP was able to integrate the far right into its ranks. Supporters of the most conservative positions in Spanish politics were contained within this party, with only fringe parties to their right.\nHowever, the momentum of Europe\u2019s far right, coupled with the conflict over Catalan independence reaching a crescendo in 2017, created the perfect conditions for a Spanish far-right party to emerge beyond the confines of the PP. First came the political space, and Vox expanded to fill it \u2013 the party itself had existed since 2014, when it was formed by dissatisfied members of the (then ruling) PP.\nIn the social sphere, two particularities differentiate Spain from its neighbouring countries. These are closely tied to the main ideological channels of the European far right.\nThe first of these is Spain\u2019s strong pro-European sentiment. Unlike other countries in northern and central Europe, Spain had a hard time joining the European Union, and has benefited greatly from it. According to the latest Eurobarometer, Spain is among the five countries with the highest pro-EU sentiment in the bloc.\nVox, however, has shown somewhat Euro-sceptic attitudes. It opposes the EU and its institutions, but also casts itself as a defender of \u201cEuropean nations and their citizens\u201d. It seeks to \u201cdefend the primacy of the [Spanish] Constitution over European law\u201d, and has even flirted with the idea of \u201cSpexit\u201d in the past.\nThe other peculiarity is migration. Spain has not, until relatively recently, been a destination for many migrants, nor has it suffered the same migratory pressure as other countries.\nIn the last two decades, Spain has been more of a transit country to reach Europe, especially for migrants from North Africa, meaning immigration has not been a longstanding concern for Spaniards. However, this is changing, and immigration has become one of the main concerns for Spaniards in recent years.\nAlthough research does not highlight immigration as a primary reason for Vox\u2019s electoral support, this may change in the near future. Anti-immigrant political discourse suits the political narrative of far-right parties, as it creates an us-them dynamic that polarises the electorate.\nThere is little mainstream anti-immigration sentiment in Spain, but the far right is doing its utmost to create it. The difference is that in Spain this sentiment is linked more to questions of security and national identity than labour shortages or economic concerns, as is the case in other countries.\nVox\u2019s current strategy involves distancing and differentiating itself from the PP, which was why it exited all its local government pacts last summer. This means that, in terms of eyeing up a national coalition, neither the PP nor Vox are actively seeking to work with one another.\nEach party courts a different electorate. To win an election, the PP will need to woo voters from the ruling centre-left PSOE, meaning it has to keep (or be seen to keep) the far right at arm\u2019s length. Vox, for its part, cannot move too close to the PP\u2019s positions or it will cede votes to them.\nThis split means both parties have to distance themselves from one another so they can welcome more voters. In this sense, the recent Patriots for Europe summit in Madrid was nothing more than a public presentation for Vox in a space shared with other far-right European entities. It was also a great ceremony for Vox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, to rescue himself from the margins and from dependence on the PP \u2013 it grants him his own political life, his own space, and his own partners who already govern other countries.\nSpain\u2019s regional parties \u2013 which are especially strong in Catalonia and the Basque Country, two of Spain\u2019s wealthiest regions \u2013 also hold great power on the national stage. Regional right-wing parties, such as the Catalan nationalist Junts per Catalunya, even include aspects of the extreme right. Its hyper-nationalism makes Junts even more nativist than Vox, and it aspires to have greater influence over decisions on migration and immigration policy in Catalonia.\nThe Spanish far right is at home among its European counterparts. They share a populist rhetoric and a narrative charged with negative emotions towards the \u201cother\u201d. Their aim is to stoke the electorate\u2019s fears and engender feelings of anxiety and aversion towards anything considered different or strange.\nThe Spanish and European far right is, above all else, a polarising, emotional right, which uses its fiery rhetoric to generate new divisions in society. Spain\u2019s political and social idiosyncrasies have kept it at bay for now, but there is no telling what the future holds.\nErika Jar\u00e1iz Gul\u00edas is Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Santiago de Compostela.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nOn April 29, 2020, a large asteroid is expected to fly by earth at a distance of approximately 4 million miles. That may be of interest to stargazers, but the previous sentence isn't very alarming or attention-grabbing. Yet many media outlets wrote headlines about this incoming asteroid as if it posed an immediate and catastrophic threat to the planet.\nAn article in the Daily Express, for instance, was headlined: \"Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM asteroid approach - Could end civilisation if it hits.\" The site used a similar message when promoting this article on Twitter:\nWhile these headlines may bring clicks, they also may lead readers to falsely believe that this asteroid poses an immediate threat to life on Earth. That isn't the case.\nWhile Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) will approach Earth in April 2020, the asteroid is not expected to come within 3.9 million miles of the planet.\nNASA is constantly monitoring the skies for asteroids and meteors that pose a potential threat to Earth. When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn't making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\nWhile an asteroid of this size would cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there's practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won't come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nAsteroid Watch, the official Twitter account of the CNEOS, attempted to quell fears about this asteroid, writing that it will \"safely pass\" Earth and that NASA did not issue a \"warning\" about a possible catastrophic collision.\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) is not currently listed on NASA's \u00a0list of potential future Earth impact events.\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories.\n[...]\nNo one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.\nNASA is currently tracking about 20,000 NEOs. While these objects routinely pass by Earth without incident, every now and again a media outlet will write an outlandish story about how one of these objects is posed to wipe out life on earth. While we've seen several of these fear-mongering rumors over the years, these \"doomsday\" asteroids never seem to arrive.\nKettley, Sebastian. \u00a0 \"Asteroid Warning: NASA Tracks a 4KM Asteroid Approach - Could End Civilisation if it Hits.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Daily Express. \u00a0 4 March 2020.\nStrickland, Ashley. \u00a0 \"Large Asteroid Will Fly by the Earth Next Month, But Won't Hit Us, Reassures NASA.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 3 March 2020.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Mosaic of Eros' Northern Hemisphere - NASA Jet Propulsion \u2026\nWhile NEAR Shoemaker orbits Eros, the asteroid appears too large for the camera's field of view. In order to get a complete view of the surface from a particular vantage point, several images are mosaiced. To do this, the digital images returned by the spacecraft are draped over a computer model of the asteroid's shape.\nThis spectacular view -- looking down on the north polar region -- was constructed from six images taken February 29, 2000, from an orbital altitude of about 200 kilometers (124 miles). This vantage point highlights the major physiographic features of the northern hemisphere: the saddle seen at the bottom; the 5.3-kilometer (3.3-mile) diameter crater at the top; and a major ridge system running between the two features that spans at least one-third of the asteroid's circumference.\nBuilt and managed by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland, NEAR was the first spacecraft launched in NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost, small-scale planetary missions.

Now the company behind her has a new vision: to mass-produce robots by the end of the year.\nHanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, said four models, including Sophia, would start rolling out of factories in the first half of 2021, just as researchers predict the pandemic will open new opportunities for the robotics industry.\n\u2018The world of Covid-19 is going to need more and more automation to keep people safe,\u2019 founder and chief executive David Hanson said, standing surrounded by robot heads in his lab.\nHanson believes robotic solutions to the pandemic are not limited to healthcare, but could assist customers in industries such as retail and airlines too.\n\u2018Sophia and Hanson robots are unique by being so human-like,\u2019 he added. \u2018That can be so useful during these times where people are terribly lonely and socially isolated.\u2019\nHanson said he aims to sell \u2018thousands\u2019 of robots in 2021, both large and small, without providing a specific number.\nSocial robotics professor Johan Hoorn, whose research has included work with Sophia, said that although the technology is still in relative infancy, the pandemic could accelerate a relationship between humans and robots.\nMORE: Police robot \u2018Digidog\u2019 labelled racist because of the communities it patrols\nMORE: Engineer creates robotic glove that uses AI to strengthen muscle grip\nStay on top of the headlines with daily email updates.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

We are all waiting to see what God can do. They are my only children I have on Earth,\u201d Fatima Usman, whose two children were among those abducted, told Reuters by phone.\nAnother parent, Hassan Abdullahi, told Reuters that local vigilantes had tried to repel the gunmen but were overpowered.\n\u201cSeventeen of the students abducted are my children. I feel very sad that the government has neglected us completely in this area,\u201d Abdullahi said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n### Hundreds of Nigerian students missing after attack on school\nPeople gather inside the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Nigeria. Photo / AP\nHundreds of Nigerian students are missing after gunmen attacked a secondary school in the country's northwestern Katsina state, police said\nThe military was reportedly in gunfights with bandits in a forest as it tried to find the students.\nThe Government Science Secondary School in Kankara was attacked on Saturday by\nPolice engaged the attackers \"in a gunfight that gave (some of) the students the opportunity to scale the fence of the school and run for safety,\" Isah said.\nAbout 400 students are missing, while 200 are accounted for, Isah said. The school is believed to have had more than 600 students.\n\"The police, Nigerian Army and Nigerian Air Force are working closely with the school authorities to ascertain the actual number of the missing and/or kidnapped students,\" said Isah. \"Search parties are working with a view to find or rescue the missing students.\"\nA resident of the town, Mansur Bello, told AP that the attackers took some of the students away.\nThe military, supported by airpower, has located the bandits' enclave in Zango/Paula forest in the Kankara area, and there have been exchanges of gunfire in an ongoing operation, said President Muhammadu Buhari, according to a statement issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\"Our prayers are with the families of the students, the school authorities and the injured,\" said the president's statement. It did not say if any students have been rescued.\nThis attack, the latest on a school by gunmen in Nigeria, is believed to have been carried out by one of several groups of bandits active in northwestern Nigeria. The groups are notorious for kidnapping people for ransom.\nThe most serious school attack occurred in April 2014, when members of the jihadist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in Chibok in northeastern Borno State. About 100 of the girls are still missing.\n- AP\nThe US Geological Survey warned 'hazardous tsunami waves are possible'.",

(Not to mention that the ATF is tasked with enforcing laws, not making them; the latter privilege still rests with the federal legislative body known as Congress.)\nAssociated Media Coverage is a well-known purveyor of fake news, a site that has previously published false stories concerning a\u00a0motorcycle curfew\u00a0and a ban on religious content on Facebook. Although many readers may now be familiar with Associated Media Coverage's reputation, the site has recently started publishing articles under the banner for a fictitious newspaper called \"The Boston Tribune\":\nWhile Associated Media Coverage may be changing their name to The Boston Tribune, their content is still nothing more than fake news.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### A group of open-carry gun rights advocates marched \u2026\nAudra Schroeder\nSXSW gets its share of activists, marketers, and trend forecasters attempting to sell you on their brand. This afternoon, a group of open-carry gun advocates marched through downtown Austin to promote theirs, and Second Amendment rights.\nA group representing the Austin chapter of Come and Take It Texas walked from the Capitol building to Sixth Street, downtown Austin\u2019s main SXSW thoroughfare, during the first day of the music portion of the festival.\nThey were armed, and though loaded magazines were allowed, no one could march with a bullet in the chamber. As they walked past a sometimes confused lunchtime office crowd, they shouted their own personal mantras:\n\u201cThis gun rally is Texas peace!\u201d\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the second amendment we can\u2019t have the first!\u201d\n\u201cWe have the right to protect our women and children!\u201d\nThe march was an effort to raise awareness about gun rights, but also to protest Facebook\u2019s recent policy change, which\u00a0would make it harder to buy and sell guns on that site, as well as\u00a0Instagram.\nOn Saturday, the group was downtown to protest a SXSW panel on how to disrupt the gun lobby via digital engagement. Photos quickly circulated on social media, causing some out-of-town attendees to wonder if this happened every day. That rally also attracted some curious celebrities.\nJeremy Walker marched today as an \u201cindependent advocate for human rights.\u201d He says guns are necessary in a free society, and gun owners are \u201ca population of the people, for the people, and by the people. And so it is the people who are the government. and with that, no entity who calls themselves the government can supercede who the people are through their enumerated rights. \u2026 If the largest free army in the world is disarmed, the whole world will be enslaved.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to be out here,\u201d he added, \u201cbut my spirit brought me out here today for reasons unknown to me.\u201d\nBethany Malone, who walked with two other women, says this is her first open-carry march:\n\u201cI just wanted to see what it was all about, and I believe it is a right that we have. It\u2019s our Second Amendment right so I\u2019m supporting that. There\u2019s nothing antagonistic about what we\u2019re doing here. \u2026 We\u2019re just trying to show a wider variety of people that guns aren\u2019t what\u2019s scary. What\u2019s scary is when the bad guys have them.\u201d\nWithin the march, there was one counterprotest: a woman advocating for \u201cless guns, more boobs.\u201d She followed the group with her breasts bravely exposed to the afternoon sun. Unfazed, a dude in a suit walked beside her, texting.\nAt one point on Sixth Street, passersby told a police officer monitoring the march that the topless woman was the real threat, and that she should be arrested. It was hard to tell if they were joking.\nSeeing the group walk down Sixth Street in the midst of SXSW was a bit surreal, but none of the music fans and day partiers taking pictures of the group seemed that upset or freaked out. When asked what he thought of the march and the right to open carry, a young man outside a club appropriately called Buckshot said he\u2019s fine with it because \u201cIt\u2019s all about freedom and, like, boobs.\u201d\nIndeed, this march didn\u2019t look that out of place among the carnival of SXSW: The \u201ccool\u201d realtors advocating for people to move to Austin and buy a house, or the Doritos social media managers trying to coax fans into doing lame stunts for Lady Gaga tickets. SXSW has become not a place for big ideas, necessarily, but a stage for new marketng strategies. People treated them like they were just another amusement in SXSW\u2019s pinball machine of marketing, one to be Instagrammed and tweeted about.\nPhotos by Audra Schroeder\nToys \u201cR\u201d Us animated its iconic giraffe using AI\u2014and people are upset\nHow Black women are revolutionizing TikTok\u2019s princesscore\nThe enduring appeal of the \u2018youth pastor voice\u2019 meme\nFans react to Nicki Minaj\u2019s husband threatening Cardi B and Offset\nShare this article\nTAGS\nAudra Schroeder was a senior entertainment writer at the Daily Dot, focusing on streaming, comedy, and music.

In an article that has since been deleted, Maine news outlet WMTW reported:\nMaine lobsterman catches extremely rare purple lobster\nA Maine lobsterman said he was shocked when he netted a rare purple lobster last week.\nKeith Potter netted the purple lobster on Tuesday off the coast of Winter Harbor.\nThese are not genuine photographs of a purple lobster.\nThese digitally manipulated images appear to have first been shared to the private Facebook group All Things Lobstering and show a user named Keith Potter. While these pictures were originally shared in jest, they eventually escaped the confines of this Facebook group, were mistaken for real, and ended up on the pages of several local news outlets.\nPotter took to Facebook on Oct. 28 to confess that the \"purple lobster\" in these images was created with Photoshop:\nStop messaging me about that fake purple lobster it was a joke I posted in a closed group and someone took it and shared it, if you read the comments you can tell it was a joke ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and if you're butthurt over a photoshopped lobster please get a life ??\nWe took a closer look at these pictures and can understand how people were fooled. We don't see any obvious errors that would give them away as fake. However, a \"purple lobster\" of this size off the coast of Maine wouldn't just be a rare catch. It would practically be a historic one.\nThe Maine lobster (Homarus Americanus) is typically a mottled brown color but can also be found in a several colorful variations. Maine Lobsterman's Community Alliance reports that blue, calico, orange, and even white Maine lobsters have been documented:\nWhile Professor Robert Steneck, a marine biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, said that a purple-colored lobster was technically possible, we have yet to encounter any genuine photographs or news reports about such a catch off the coast of Maine.\nHere's a video with more detail about lobster color variations:\nWhile the large Maine lobster may not frequently (or ever) be seen in the color purple, a smaller genus of lobster called the reef lobster (Enoplometopus) that lives in the warm waters of the Caribbean can be seen in a wide variety of bright colors. Here's a photograph of a purple reef lobster:\nSmithsonian. \u00a0 \"A Rainbow of Colorful Lobsters.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 30 October 2019.\nMaine Lobstermen's Community Alliance. \u00a0 \"Lobster 101: Color.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 30 October 2019.\nWMTW. \u00a0 \"Maine Lobsterman Catches Extremely Rare Purple Lobster.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 28 October 2019.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### hope this is the right place for this... this is a rare \u2026\nThe subreddit for cute pictures of bugs, lobsters, squid, and other non-Vertebrata.\n\nBecause they're adorable too.\nGet up to 90% off for 6 months\nHe's his own blacklight!\nDid they let him go?

In October, Trinseo and Synthos entered into an amendment to the original purchase agreement to reduce the cash purchase price from $449.4 million to $402.4 million in exchange for an equivalent amount ($47.0 million) of net working capital to be collected by Trinseo. Following Trinseo\u2019s collection of the net working capital, the expected net cash proceeds are approximately $400 million after transaction-related costs and taxes.\nThe Business includes approximately 440 employees, mostly located in Schkopau, Germany.

        "article_texts": "### Mike Pompeo Lied About the U.S. and Middle East.\n\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nTrump\u2019s secretary of state gave a speech in Cairo that obscured the U.S. role in the Middle East. America has not been a force for good.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, center, speaks to the press during a tour of the newly inaugurated Al-Fattah Al-Alim mosque in Egypt\u2019s new administrative capital, east of Cairo, on Jan. 10, 2019.\n\u201cTHE GOOD NEWS is this: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over.\u201d\nSo said Mike Pompeo in Cairo on Thursday. Donald Trump\u2019s hawkish secretary of state delivered a speech at the site of Barack Obama\u2019s famous 2009 address to the Muslim world,\u00a0but Pompeo denounced the former president for \u201cwishful thinking,\u201d partnering \u201cwith enemies,\u201d and a reluctance \u201cto wield our influence\u201d in the region.\nPompeo claimed that the United States was \u201ca force for good in the Middle East\u201d and referred to \u201cAmerica\u2019s innate goodness.\u201d His 3,500-word address at the American University in Cairo contained only one passing reference to \u201cdemocracy\u201d and zero references to \u201cequality\u201d or \u201chuman rights.\u201d There were more than 20 references, however, to \u201cmalevolent\u201d and \u201coppressive\u201d Iran.\nShadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy,\u00a0described it \u201cas one of the worst foreign policy speeches I\u2019ve witnessed from a senior U.S. official,\u201d calling it \u201ccynical, petty, incoherent, small, and, well, silly.\u201d Paul Danahar, former BBC Middle East bureau chief, referred to the speech as \u201csimplistic,\u201d noting that \u201cits theme was the goodness of Israel and evil of Iran.\u201d\nThe pompous Pompeo told his audience in Cairo that he was going to be \u201cvery blunt and direct\u201d and that he wanted to speak about \u201ca truth that isn\u2019t often spoken in this part of the world.\u201d He went on to offer a litany of lies, delusions, and exaggerations. Below, however, is the (fantasy) speech that I wish the secretary of state could have delivered on Thursday, if he truly wanted to be \u201cblunt\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d about U.S. involvement in the Middle East since 1945.\n\u201cIT IS A PLEASURE to be back here in Cairo. As America\u2019s top diplomat, and as a former CIA director and four-term member of the United States Congress, not to mention a senior member of a U.S. administration whose president has admitted we have \u2018a lot of killers\u2019 and who has also condemned many of our previous interventions across the Middle East, I believe I am ideally suited to tell you all the unvarnished truth about the history and impact of U.S. involvement in this region.\nIt is an ugly truth that U.S. presidents have known for decades but have worked hard to conceal from the public \u2014 both in the United States and here in the Middle East. As long ago as 1958, a great Republican president, and an even greater U.S. general, Dwight Eisenhower,\u00a0wondered why there was such a \u2018campaign of hatred against us\u2019 in this part of the world, \u2018not by the governments but by the people.\u2019 Yet the reasons for that \u2018hatred\u2019 had been laid out for him only a few months earlier by his own National Security Council: \u2018In the eyes of the majority of Arabs the United States appears to be opposed to the realization of the goals of Arab nationalism. They believe that the United States is seeking to protect its interest in Near East oil by supporting the status quo and opposing political or economic progress.\u2019 U.S. interests in the area, added the National Security Council, \u2018have led not unnaturally to close U.S. relations with elements in the Arab world whose primary interest lies in the maintenance of relations with the West and the status quo in their countries.\u2019\nIt is difficult to disagree with the\u00a0National Security Council\u2019s assessment. Take the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In February 1945, in the dying days of the\u00a0World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s founding king, Abdulaziz, onboard the USS Quincy in the Suez Canal. The need for democracy in the Gulf wasn\u2019t on\u00a0Roosevelt\u2019s mind. On behalf of the United States, he struck a Faustian bargain with one of the world\u2019s most repressive countries: We would provide them with security; they would provide us with oil.\nThat bargain has held for more than seven decades, under both Democratic and Republican presidents. It held after 9/11, when 15 of the 19 hijackers turned out to be Saudi nationals \u2014 but we invaded Baghdad in 2003, not Riyadh. It held after my predecessor Hillary Clinton admitted in a confidential memo that \u2018donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.\u2019 It held after a Saudi-led coalition launched a war\u00a0in Yemen, with U.S. military and intelligence support, which has killed tens of thousands of people and has caused, in the words of the United Nations, the \u2018world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\u2019 It held even after U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul 100 days ago, on the orders \u2014\u00a0according to my former colleagues at the CIA\u00a0\u2014 of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman.\nThen there is the state of Israel. From the very beginning, we have stood with the Israelis against the Arabs \u2014 and, in particular, against the occupied and dispossessed Palestinian people. President Harry Truman, declaring U.S. support for a new Jewish state, said he had \u2018to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism: I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.\u2019 Over the past 70 years, the United States has backed, armed, and funded Israeli governments, of both left and right, as they have bombed, conquered, occupied, colonized, and ethnically cleansed Arab lands.\nIn 2014, the previous U.S. administration resupplied Israeli forces with ammunition amid their bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which killed more than 500 Palestinian children in the space of seven weeks.\nIn 2018, this administration went against both the international community and international law to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move our embassy there.\nWe have never supported freedom or democracy for the Palestinians. Nor have we done so for the Iranians. In 1953, the United States government authorized a CIA coup to overthrow the elected prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh, because we believed he was too close to his country\u2019s Communist Party. CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt, grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, arrived in Tehran to implement Operation Ajax, which involved fomenting riots against Mossadegh in order to put the tyrannical, but pro-American, shah of Iran back in full control of the country.\nA year earlier,\u00a0Kermit Roosevelt had been here in Egypt, masterminding another CIA intervention, Project FF, or \u2018Fat Fucker,\u2019 against King Farouk. The United States helped the Free Officers Movement overthrow the king and \u2014 perhaps with the exception of Gamal Abdel Nasser \u2014 has since thrown its full support behind military dictators in Cairo. Remember when the generals removed Egypt\u2019s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, from power in a coup in 2013? My predecessor John Kerry praised the Egyptian military for \u2018restoring democracy.\u2019\nThen there is Iraq. Every president since George H.W. Bush has taken military action in Iraq; dropping bombs in Mesopotamia has become a rite of passage for the past five presidents of the United States. But our involvement in Iraq did not begin in 1990, when the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, infamously gave Saddam Hussein the green light to invade Kuwait; it began decades earlier.\nIn 1959, the CIA sent a six-man squad of assassins\u00a0\u2014 including a\u00a0young man named Saddam Hussein\u00a0\u2014 into Iraq to try and kill then-Iraqi Prime Minister Gen. Abd al-Karim Qasim. They failed.\nIn 1963, however, a U.S.-backed military coup by the Baath Party succeeded in overthrowing Qasim. \u2018We came to power on a CIA train,\u2019 Ali Saleh Sa\u2019adi, a minister in the Baathist regime\u00a0that replaced Qasim, later admitted.\nIn 1980, according to my predecessor Alexander Haig, the Carter administration gave\u00a0a \u2018green light\u2019 to Saddam to attack Iran. Ronald Reagan then escalated our support for the Iraqis, against the Iranians, and sent Donald Rumsfeld to shake\u00a0Saddam\u2019s hand. We not only turned a \u2018blind eye\u2018\u00a0to the use of Iraqi chemical weapons against both the Iranians and the Kurds; we helped them do it.\nBy 2003, it was the United States\u00a0that was invading Iraq, in defiance of international law and on the basis of false claims about weapons of mass destruction. As Trump, the current U.S. president, has observed, George W. Bush \u2018lied\u2018 about WMDs, and his decision to attack Iraq was \u2018the worst single mistake ever made in the history of our country.\u2019\nHundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed as a result of the war and \u2014 as the previous U.S. president has conceded\u00a0\u2014 there is a direct line from our invasion of Iraq to the creation of ISIS.\nBut what about the Arab Spring? How did the United States respond? In Syria, the U.S. government repeatedly called on the brutal Bashar al-Assad to stand down, and the CIA spent hundreds of millions of dollars arming some of the most vicious groups in the region in a disastrous attempt to try and topple him. More than seven years on from the start of the Syrian civil war, and more than 400,000 dead Syrians later, this administration has now decided to accept Assad\u2019s rule of that country, and we are withdrawing our troops on the ground.\nIn Libya, the United States backed a U.N.-sanctioned NATO operation to protect the people of Benghazi;\u00a0the operation morphed into a non-U.N.-sanctioned plan for regime change in Tripoli. Col. Muammar Gaddafi was raped and killed in the Libyan desert by U.S.-backed rebels. My predecessor Clinton greeted the news with a laugh. \u2018We came, we saw, he died,\u2019 she declared. Today, Libya is a \u2018Mad Max\u2019 hell-scape, with open-air slave markets and multiple, warring \u2018governments\u2018\u00a0and militias. It has also become a major transit point for tens of thousands of migrants heading for Europe.\nIn Bahrain, however, the United States backed the ruling royal family, not the revolution from below. This may or may not have been related to the fact that the U.S. 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. Since 2011, thousands of Bahrainis have been beaten, tear-gassed, shot, detained, and tortured. In 2017, Trump told the Bahraini king, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, that \u2018there won\u2019t be strain with this administration.\u2019 His words have since emboldened Bahrain\u2019s prison guards.\nThis is the blunt truth that previous U.S. administrations have refused to share with you until today: We have supported dictators and despots while singing the praises of democracy; we have bombed, invaded, and occupied while calling for stability and security; we have been complicit in torture, ethnic cleansing, mass starvation, and the use of chemical weapons while pretending to be champions of human rights.\nThe post-war history of our role in this region is clear, undeniable, and shameful. Those who claim that the United States is a \u2018force for good in the Middle East\u2018\u00a0are dishonest \u2014 or deluded. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could be a greater insult to the millions of people who might be alive today in the Middle East had it not been for the involvement of the United States.\nI want to thank you all for being here, and I want to dedicate this speech, in the Egyptian capital, to the 40,000 political prisoners\u00a0\u2014 including U.S. citizens! \u2014 that your president and our close ally, Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has locked up and tortured since 2014. May God bless them all; may God bless you all.\nI now plan to return to Washington, D.C., and I expect to shortly receive the news that I have been fired by our president over Twitter.\u201d\nIT\u2019S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government.\nThis is not hyperbole.\nCourt orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.\nYet far too many are still covering Trump\u2019s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as \u201cunconventional,\u201d \u201ctesting the boundaries,\u201d and \u201caggressively flexing power.\u201d\nThe Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world.

Clicking through on the social media post led users to a rogue website which displayed a fake CNN video announcing the supposed \"shocking\" death of the Smiths (along with some other adult content):\nThe purpose of this hoax appeared to be to bait users into clicking to view the video as a means of driving them to malicious web pages, and to trick them into sharing the hoax post on social media in order to spread it further. Users are strongly advised not to visit to the website that underlies this hoax post and not to click on anything displayed there.\nDavid Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### No, Will Smith Son Jaden Smith Has Not Died- Car Accident \u2026\nVerifying you are human. This may take a few seconds.\n\n### FACT CHECK: No, Jaden Smith Did Not Die In A Car \u2026\nStorage Preferences\nA post shared on Facebook claims actor Jaden Smith died in a car accident.\nVerdict: False\nJaden Smith has been active on social media since this rumor surfaced. There are no credible news reports about his alleged death.\nFact Check:\nJaden Smith, who is the son of actor Will Smith, has starred in multiple films including \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and \u201cThe Day The Earth Stood Still,\u201d according to IMDb. Now, a Feb. 23 Facebook post claims he recently died in \u201ca terrifying car accident.\u201dAnother Facebook post, with over 4,600 shares from the afternoon of Feb. 23, claimed Jaden Smith was in an intensive care unit (ICU) after being in a car accident that also involved Will Smith.\nThe claims appear to be nothing more than rumors. Jaden Smith tweeted the word \u201cInvisible,\u201d hours after the posts about his alleged death, seemingly disproving the claim. His social media posts make no reference to the rumors. His father, mother Jada Pinkett Smith and sister Willow Smith have likewise made no such statement regarding his alleged death. All three family members have been active on social media since the rumor of the car crash began circulating.\nThere are also no credible news reports suggesting Jaden Smith was in any car accident or had passed away. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims \u2018I Am Legend\u2019 Was Set In 2021 And Features \u2018People Turned Into Zombies Because Of The Wrong Vaccines\u2019)\nThe photo of the wrecked vehicle in the second Facebook post was previously published by the Montgomery County Police Reporter website in a July 2020 article about a car crash on I-45 in Texas. The article does not mention either Jaden Smith or his father Will Smith.\nThis is not the first time a celebrity has been falsely reported as dead. Check Your Fact previously debunked a claim from January 2022 that alleged Adam Sandler had committed suicide.",

At least 30,000 cubic metres need to be cleared so that work on the track can begin. Railway teams are working on a war footing and senior railway officials from Lumding Division and Headquarters are camping at the site to coordinate restoration,\u201d the statement said.\nA Dima Hasao district official said both train services and road traffic between Silchar and Haflong have been suspended due to the ongoing restoration being jointly undertaken by the railways, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and state agencies.\n\u201cThe NHAI was repairing NH27, which runs above the railway track, when rain triggered a landslide and seepage. Debris from the NH repair covered the railway stretch below. Restoration is in full swing,\u201d he said.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nRail services on the Lumding\u2013Badarpur hill section have been suspended since Monday. Twelve trains have been cancelled or partially cancelled till June 25 for passenger safety, NFR said, without setting a deadline for resumption, citing the scale of the landslide, which is \u201ccontinuing intermittently.\u201d\nThe disruption has impacted south Assam, Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur. A high-level emergency meeting was held involving officials from NFR, the state government and NHAI to review the situation.\nNFR\u2019s chief public relations officer K.K. Sharma said round-the-clock operations are underway using heavy machinery.\nCPI(M)'s John Brittas said Prime Minister Modi should speak in Parliament on Trump's claims on Operation Sindoor and Pahalgam terror attack\n\n### The mechanism of a railway landslide caused by rainfall\n1185 Accesses\n43 Citations\nExplore all metrics\nThis paper presents the study of a landslide induced by rainfall above a railway line in terms of site investigations, laboratory tests, finite element, and limit equilibrium analyses. The purpose of the study is to identify the cause and failure mechanism so as to prevent the recurrence of such failure. The slope concerned was composed of 3\u223c4\u00a0m thick fissured clay overlying highly weathered mica marble interbedded with quartz schist. The slope was cut into two steps and was protected by a masonry revetment and a thin masonry retaining wall at the toe. The region concerned suffered a whole month\u2019s light drizzle in September, after which a rainfall of an intensity of 80\u00a0mm (in 48\u00a0h) occurred 5\u00a0days prior to the failure that happened on October 5, 2004. The rainfall infiltration and a failed drainage system behind the retaining wall resulted in high saturation of the clay and finally led to an undrained failure. The short-term slope stability using total stress parameters was examined by the finite element and limit equilibrium analyses. The factors of safety of the slope obtained by the finite element and limit equilibrium analysis were 0.935 and 0.854, which are in agreement with the occurrence of failure. Since the slide took place through the interface of the soil and rock, the exposure of rock has significant effect on the stability.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution  to check access.\nPrice includes VAT (Vietnam)\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nInstitutional subscriptions\nBonnard Ch, Tacher L, Beniston M (2008) Prediction of landslide movements caused by climate change: modeling the behavior of a mean elevation large landslide in the Alps and assessing its uncertainties.

Annabelle\u2019s alive \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say alive \u2014 Annabelle\u2019s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\u201d\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.\nThe rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the \"Annabelle\" movie. Wallis talked about her new film, \"The Silencing,\" as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in \"The Mummy.\" Wallis also talked about \"running\" in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the \"escape\" scenes from \"The Mummy.\" As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping.\nVerhoeven, Beatrice. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Doll Has Not Escaped, Owner Says: \u2018Annabelle\u2019s Alive \u2013 Well, I Shouldn\u2019t Say Alive\u2019 (Video).\"\n \u00a0 \u00a0 The Wrap. \u00a0 14 August 2020.\nDavids, Brian. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Wallis on 'The Silencing' and Convincing Tom Cruise to Run With Her.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Hollywood Reporter. \u00a0 13 August 2020.\nBittar, Bill. \u00a0 \"No Trespassing Signs, Fines Used to Ward Off Curious Souls in Search of Warren\u2019s Occult Museum.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Monroe Sun. \u00a0 28 October 2019.\nAtlas Obscura. \u00a0 \"The Warren's Occult Museum.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Retrieved 14 August 2020.\nHeavy. \u00a0 \"Annabelle Doll Escaped From Warren Museum Hoax Debunked.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 14 August 2020.\nUpdated [17 August 2020]: Article updated with statement from Tony Spera.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Fact Check: The Annabelle Doll Did NOT Escape \u2026\nDid the Annabelle doll escape from the Warren's Occult Museum in August 2020? No, that's not true: The son-in-law of the famous paranormal investigators who created the museum posted a video to prove the purportedly possessed doll was still housed in the display case. This was an online rumor that was accellerated when the Annabelle doll's Wikipedia page was falsely altered.\nThe claim was debunked by the now leader of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) and the Warren's son-in-law, Tony Spera, in a YouTube video he posted soon after the Wikipedia page was altered and the rumor gained speed.\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) where it was published on August 14, 2020. The caption that accompanied a screenshot of the misinformation on the Wikipedia page read \"Annabelle doll escaped from The Warrens Occult Museum today 3.00 A.M.\" The text on the screenshot read:\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n(Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Mon Aug 17 14:03:13 2020 UTC)\nThe Wikipedia page for the doll was corrected a couple hours later, but the screenshots of the altered site are still rapidly circulating on social meida.\nThe Warren's Occult Museum, started by Ed and Lorainne Warren, two of the world's most famous paranormal investigators and authors, has been closed to visitors since 2018.\nOn August 14, the day the doll's Wikipedia page was changed, Sprea posted this video debunking the claims:\nWhile the doll enclosed in a glass case could be seen behind him, he said:\nAnnabelle did not escape... Annabelle's here in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.\nAnnabelle was purportedly possessed by a demonic spirit that has attempted to kill people and is the inspiration for a recurring character in the Conjuring Universe films.\nOne possible origin for the false Wikipedia edit: On August 13, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis that mentioned words like \"running\" and \"escape,\" which then circulated on Chinese-language social media sites. According to a fact check by Heavy.com on the same claim, this interview was misconstrued as Annabelle the doll escaping.\nSee who is sharing it (it might even be your friends...) and leave the link in the comments.:\nLead Stories is a fact checking website that is always looking for the latest false, misleading, deceptive or inaccurate stories, videos or images going viral on the internet.\nSpotted something?

Popular memes have claimed (for humorous effect) that the picture was taken in Massachusetts, or (less homorously) in Canada:\nThe image actually captures a stretch of road near the Japanese city of Towada in Aomori prefecture.\nThe photograph was taken by Mihai Apostu and posted to his blog, \"A Romanian in Japan,\" in April 2007:\nBefore heading down town we decided to take a walk up to Towada. On the way to Towada starting from April thh Gold Line Route is opened. This year's amount of snow was smaller than last year but the Hakkoda Walls are still big. Last year the walls of snow on both sides of the road were 9( nine) metres tall. This year there were only 6 metres of snow that guided us to Tsuta Onsen.\nAccording to a sightseeing guide for the Aomori region of Japan, the Hakkoda Walls are quite a tourist attraction. Heavy snowfalls frequently close the corridor during the winter, but when the spring season approaches the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad gets to work and clears the road:\nNational Highway 103, commonly known as the Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line, is a popular sightseeing route in Aomori.8 km of this Hakkoda-Towada Gold Line stretching from Sukayu to Yachi Hot Springs is closed off in winter, but thanks to the efforts of the Hakkoda Snowplow Squad, they plow through the snow from both ends to meet at Kasamatsu Pass in late March, creating a stunning snow corridor.\nIn some places the walls of snow reach a height of 9 m, allowing visitors to enjoy magnificent views of the vivid blue of the sky contrasted against the white of the snow in perfect harmony. The road opens to general traffic on April 1, but before this, a Hakkoda walk is held every year to walk through this snow corridor, and many people take part in the event.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Japan's Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route Guide | Two Wandering \u2026\nVerify you are human by completing the action below.\n\n### Climbing The Roof Of Japan - Alpine Route Guide (updated 2025)\nIf you want to see the Japan Alps with stunning mountain views, beautiful green and lush valleys, the famous and impressive 18-m tall snow wall, and turquoise lakes, then the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route is a must! Read on to get everything you need to know about the Japan Alpine Route \u2013 how to get there, how to get tickets, how long it takes, and a description of the nine sections of the route.\nAfter some days in the big, bustling Tokyo City, we were ready to dig deeper into Japan and discover its more relaxed green side. So, a Swedish couple we met on a train in Kyoto said: \u201cWhat do Norwegians do when they get to a country with mountains?!\u201d\nYep, you guessed it, since we come from a country full of mountains and fjords and therefore obviously love mountains, we headed inland to the Japan Alps to do the stunning Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route, also called The Japanese Alpine Route. It was one of the biggest highlights of our entire trip to Japan! \ud83d\ude42 You can see our Japan itinerary here.\nThe Japan Alps is a fairly big area inland of mid-Japan, with a few big cities such as Nagano, Matsumoto, and Toyama. This area is a nature bliss packed with high mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and wilderness. It surely is a hiker`s delight!\nWe decided to travel/ hike along the spectacular Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route when we visited Japan, and we loved it! It was so refreshing after spending weeks in the big cities of Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Tokyo!\nTable of Contents:\nTateyama Kurobe Alpine Route is a popular and scenic 90 km route that crosses the northern part of the Japanese Alps from the east (Shinano Omachi Station) to the west (Toyama Station). You take different means of transport to get over the mountain pass, like cable cars and switch-back trains. You decide for yourself how much walking you want to do.\nThese Northern Alps, also called the Hida Mountains, stretch through Nagano, Toyama, and Gifu prefectures with several tall mountain peaks. The tallest mountain along the Japan Alpine Route is Mt. Tateyama (3015 m).\nThe Alpine Route is open from the 15th of April to the 30th of November.\nThe Alpine Route is completely closed during winter, from the 1st of December until the 14th of April.\nThe Alpine Route connects Shinano Omachi Station on the east side of the Japan Alps with Toyama Station on the west side (see the map below), and takes about 6-7 hours in total:\nTateyama Kurobe Alpine Route goes from east to west through the northern part of the Japanese Alps. You will take eight different means of transport. The whole trip takes 6-7 hours (although we used 9 as we did some hiking too).\nIt is an incredible journey through sacred mountains, wilderness, forests, impressive tunnels, high peaks, hot springs, and Japan`s highest dam, Kurobe Dam. Plus, a ton of fresh mountain air!\nIn spring, April \u2013 June, the Alpine Route is literally carved through the snow, making an impressive 18-meter-high snow wall! The snow wall is a huge attraction in Japan and is a fantastic sight! Even at the end of June, the snow wall is usually over 10 meters high.\nIn autumn, September \u2013 November, the leaves change color from green to beautiful autumn colors of red, yellow, orange, and brown. It is a stunning sight!\nWe did the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route from east to west, starting in Shinano Omachi and ending up in Toyama.\nYou can do the Alpine Route in either direction, also from west to east (Toyama to Shinano Omachi). Most people do it one way only, but you can do it as a round-trip. Or you can only do half the Alpine Route and make a return trip to Murodo, which is the route\u00b4s highest point.\nThis guide describes how to do the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route from east to west, starting in Matsumoto and ending in Toyama, and on to Kanazawa.\nThe Alpine Route is divided into nine stops and eight sections, each with different means of transport and walking distances.\nThe Alpine Route has 9 stops and 8 sections of different means of transport (from east to west):\nA great place to spend the night before doing the Alpine Route is Matsumoto (like we did, as it is only a 1-hour train ride from Shinano Omachi) or Nagano (a 2,5-hour train ride from Shinano Omachi). And from Toyama, I recommend you go to Kanazawa (a 35-minute train ride from Toyama) to spend a few\u00a0nights.\nGetting To The Start of Alpine Route (Shinano Omachi):\nFrom Tokyo, we took the train to Matsumoto City (a 4-hour train trip), where we stayed the night at the hotel Onyado Nono Matsumoto Natural Hot Spring (the only decent hotel in Matsumoto, in our opinion).\nEarly the next morning, we took the train from Matsumoto Station to Shinano Omachi Station \u2013 the start of the Alpine Route (a 1-hour train trip).\nYou can also start from, for instance, Nagano. The train trip from Nagano to Shinano Omachi takes about 2,5 hours.\nWe bought the Japan Railway Pass (JR Pass) online before entering Japan, which we used on these two train trips (Tokyo \u2013 Matsumoto and Matsumoto \u2013 Shinano Omachi).\nMatsumoto is a relatively small valley city by Japanese standards (243,000 inhabitants) embraced by seven tall peaks (all above 3000 m) and three smaller ones. The valley where Matsumoto is situated is no more than 20 km across at its widest. It is a cozy little city with one of Japan\u2019s biggest attractions \u2013 Matsumoto Castle, or Crow Castle, as it is also called due to its black and white color.\nWe stayed at Onyado Nono Matsumoto Natural Hot Spring. This is the only decent hotel in Matsumoto, to be honest.\nWe woke up at the crack of dawn in Matsumoto, checked out of the hotel, and took the 08:00 (8 am) train to Shinano-Omachi Station, where the Alpine Route starts.\n\u21d2 Read Next:\u00a0 Our Ultimate Guide to Matsumoto\nStop 1 \u2013 721 m above sea level:\nShinano Omachi is where the Alpine Route starts on the eastern side.\nWhen we arrived at the Shinano-Omachi Station, we went straight over to the Baggage Forwarding Service office to drop off our backpacks.\nThe Baggage Forwarding Service office (marked \u201cAlps Roman Kan\u201c) is on your right when you get out of the Shinano Omachi Train Station.\nThe cost per bag is 2500 JPY from Shinano Omachi Station to Toyama Station (where the Alpine Route ends on the west side). It might feel a little expensive, but it is really a must-do, as traveling with big bags and suitcases on the Alpine Route would be really uncomfortable.\nThe Alpine Route Forwarding Service Office at Shinano Omachi Station is open from 07:40 to 10:30 for drop-off.\nYou can then pick up your bags at the end of the Alpine Route (the west side) \u2013 Toyama Station (between 15:30 and 18:00). The baggage forwarding service was, however, not open for service in November 2023 (the last day was 31. October 2023). So, if you are doing the Alpine Route in November, you should check if the baggage forwarding service is still operative.\nYou can also have your bags picked up at your hotel and delivered to your next hotel. Read more about the Baggage Forwarding Service here.\nAfter we got rid of our bags, we jumped on the bus to Stop 2 of the Alpine Route: Ogizawa (the bus departs right in front of the Shinano-Omachi Station).\nBus ticket office.\nOn the bus to from Shinano-Omachi Ogizawa.\nSection 1: Take the bus from Shinano-Omachi to Ogizawa (a 40-minute bus ride).\nStop 2 \u2013 1433 m asl:\nThe bus ride from Shinano-Omachi to Ogizawa takes about 40 minutes.\nDuring that time, the weather, unfortunately, turned really bad! It was raining cats and dogs! \ud83d\ude41 Ah, how unlucky! Our mood sank, and we started to think that we had not picked the right day for our Alpine Route adventure and regretted the whole thing.\nWhen we arrived at Ogizawa, it was raining heavily. We even thought about skipping the Alpine Route and returning to Tokyo. But we had already handed in our luggage at Shinano-Omachi Station for baggage forwarding to Toyama Station, so there was no turning back.\nWe made the 10:00 trolley bus departure from Stop 2: Ogizawa to Stop 3: Kurobe Dam.\nThe trolley bus ride was pretty cool and took us through a 5,8 km tunnel up to the giant Kurobe Dam. The trolley bus ride took 16 minutes.\nSection 2: Take the trolley bus from Ogizawa to Kurobe Dam (a 16-minute ride).\nStop 3 \u2013 1470 m asl :\nWhen we exited the trolley bus and the tunnel, the weather had improved and stopped raining! Yay! We were so happy! \ud83d\ude42\nThe Kurobe Dam is Japan`s highest dam (186 m) and a very impressive sight!\nWe climbed the 220 steps up to the Observation Desk from the trolley bus station.\nLots of steps up to the Observation Deck.\nGreat view from the stairs.\nOnce on top, we were rewarded with amazing views over the dam and its surroundings! All the steps were totally worth it! \ud83d\ude42\nIncredibly, 10 tons of water shoot out of the dam every second! EVERY SECOND! Oh my god, that is a LOT of water! \ud83d\ude42\nAfter World War II, Japan had a sudden economic boom and faced a severe energy shortage. To generate additional electricity, the government invested in hydroelectric power and decided to build the Kurobe Dam.\nImpressive and a bit scary to stand on the dam and look down on the water.\nThe water pours down into a beautiful valley with a river.\nUnbelievably, 10 million people worked on the dam during its construction! The hardest part was apparently digging the tunnel that the Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus now runs through.\nAfter the dam\u2019s construction, a movie entitled \u201cSun over Kurobe\u201d was released starring famous Japanese actors. This film gave the Kurobe Dam a legendary status similar to the Hoover Dam in the USA.\nInside the mountain is a museum where you can read and see a movie from when the dam was built.\nUnfortunately, not much of it is in English. Here is also a memorial monument to the 171 workers who sadly lost their lives during the construction of the dam.\nAfter we had admired the view from the Observation Deck and been to the museum, we walked on the pathway across the dam (which took about 15 minutes) to the Kurobeko cable car station on the other side.\nHere, we jumped on the underground cable car, which took us to Kurobedaira (5 minutes).\nThe cable car to Kurobedaira.\nThe cable car trip took 5 minutes, and went through a tunnel.\nSection 3: Take the cable from Kurobe Dam to Kurobedaira (a 5-minute ride).\nStop 4 \u2013 1828 m asl:\nWhen we stepped out of the cable car, we were hit by the cool, fresh, and clear mountain air. It was so refreshing to breathe in the air and take in the breathtaking mountain scenery all around us.\nBy this time, the sun had decided to peek out from the clouds and say hi to us. Very nice! \ud83d\ude42\nAfter taking in the mountain view, we took the Tateyama Ropeway, which brought us 488 m further up to Daikanbo. The Ropeway took 7 minutes, and the views were spectacular!\nSection 4: Take the ropeway from Kurobedaira to Daikanbo (a 7-minute ropeway ride).\nStop 5 \u2013 2316 m asl:\nFrom Daikanbo, the views were even better than at Kurobe Dam. The view over the valley below with its small greenish lake was absolutely stunning!\nAfter a short break and a sit-down at the Daikanbo observation deck, taking in the sun and the views, we boarded another trolley bus. This time, it was a tunneling one through Mt Tateyama for 3,7 km to Murodo. This trolley bus took 10 minutes.\nSection 5: Take the trolley bus from Daikanbo to Murodo (a 10-minute ride).\nStop 6 \u2013 2450 m asl:\nAnd \u201cwoooosh\u201c, after 10 minutes on the trolley bus, we were all of a sudden on the other side of the 3015 m high Mountain Tateyama.\nMurodo is the highest point on the Alpine Route unless you want to climb Mt Tateyama on foot.\nIn the 17th-19th centuries, Mt Tateyama became one of Japan\u2019s three holy mountains along with Mt. Fuji and Mt. Hakusan and became very popular among pilgrims. Mt. Tateyama, overlooking the valley of hell, came to represent heaven. People were climbing Mt. Tateyama, hoping that their souls would go to heaven after their death. Unfortunately, due to the fog and cloudy weather, we did not even see Mt Tateyama.\nFrom Murodo, you can take several short and long hikes to the neighboring mountains and mountain huts, cafes, and onsens (hot springs).\nHere, you feel that you are in nature and the mountains.\nWe decided to do a short loop hike to Mikurigaike Pond, also called Mikuri Pond.\nEven at 2450 m, we found some beautiful mountain flowers. In comparison, the highest mountain back home in Norway, Scandinavia\u2019s highest mountain, is Galdh\u00f8piggen at 2469 m. We have climbed it, and it is only rocks and snow and no grass, flowers, or anything. So it is a bit strange but very nice to be at this latitude with so much vegetation around.\nFinally, we reached Mikurigaike Pound.\nThe hike is about 2,6 km long and is an easy hike on a solid brick stone walking path. The hike took us about 40 minutes in total (loop).\nThe view from the hike is breathtaking, with majestic mountains on all sides. You get to see the famous Mount Tsurugi and Tateyama Three Mountains (also called Mount Tate) on a clear day:\nThe Oyama Mountain even has a shrine on the top, called Oyama Shrine.\nAt this highest point of the Alpine Route, there is actually a hotel called Hotel Tateyama! I know, it was a big surprise for us too.\nAt Hotel Tateyama, there is a restaurant/ cafe and even Japan\u2019s highest onsen (hot spring)! This is the perfect place to stay if you want to do the Alpine Route over several days and go hiking in the area or relax a bit with fantastic mountain views.\nFrom Hotel Tateyama, there are several great hiking options, like the Jigokudani Onsen (Hell Valley Hot Springs), which is about 20 20-minute hike. But this is not a bathing onsen, as the water is boiling hot!\nYou can also hike to the east, for about two hours, to the peak Oyama (3003 m), which apparently has a very steep final section. It is also possible to hike for several days/ a week further south to Kamikochi. Or you can walk to Mt. Tateyama (about 4 hours).\nThe hotel organized several excellent free tours, like stargazing, hiking, and bird-watching. And you can borrow snow boots and hiking poles for free.\nSection 6: Take the bus from Murodo to Bijodaira (a 50-minute bus ride).\nStop 7 \u2013 927 m asl:\nAfter our hike to Mikurigaike Pond, we continued the trek by bus to Bijodaira. The bus ride took about 50 minutes, through green and lush forest with huge cedar trees.\nIt is possible to break the trip from Murodo to Bijodaira and stop for walks along the way, but unfortunately, we did not have the time.\nSection 7: Take the cable car from Bijodaira to Tateyama (a 7-minute ride).\nStop 8 \u2013 475 m asl:\nThe last stage of the Alpine Route is with the cable car down from Bijodaira to Tateyama, which takes 7 minutes.\nPin\nSection 8: Take the train from Tateyama Station to Toyama Station (a 1-hour train ride).\nStop 9 \u2013 475 m asl:\nFrom Tateyama Station, we took the train to Toyama Station (1 hour).\nAt Toyama train station, we picked up our backpacks. It was, however, a bit tricky to find the office where the Baggage Delivery Center is! It turned out there is no real office; you just have to talk to the ticket officer at the train platform, and he will give you your luggage. \ud83d\ude42\nWe reached Toyama at approximately 17:00 in the afternoon. We started out in Matsumoto at 08:00, so the whole Alpine Route took us nine hours (from Matsumoto to Toyama).\nThe baggage pick-up office at the other end of the Alpine Route (Toyama Station) closes at 18:00 (6 pm), so ensure you reach Toyama Station before it closes.\nWe took the train from Toyama to Kanazawa (35 min), where we booked\u00a0a room at KOKO HOTEL Premier Kanazawa Korinbo. The hotel was fantastic! Very good location in the middle of everything, and brand new. I will highly recommend it!\nClick here for the latest prices on KOKO Hotel Premier Kanazawa\n\u21d2 Read Next: Our Ultimate Guide to Kanazawa\nThe Alpine Route Japan is a very nice trip! We really enjoyed it, and we\u2019re pleased that the weather turned out OK in the end. It was lovely to breathe in some fresh mountain air again and get to see some breathtaking mountain scenery. We highly recommend the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route!\nIf you want to book a guided mountain hiking tour, like Mt. Tateyama or a snowshoe tour, then the Tateco \u2013 Tateyama Eco Tours is a great choice and has a lot of tours to choose from.\nAltogether, we spent approximately 9 hours on the entire Alpine Route:\n1. Train Matsumoto \u2013 Shinano Omachi\u00a0 (1 hour)\nThis train is NOT included in the Alpine Route ticket, so you have to buy this train ticket separately.\nWe bought a 14-day Japan Rail Pass, which we used on this train ride. However, this pass is only for tourists, and you have to buy it outside of Japan before you go there. You can order a JR Pass online from official JR Pass agents such as JRailPass.com.\nClick here for prices & information on how to order the JR Pass online\nShinano-Omachi Train Station is where the baggage forwarding service is (open for drop-off from 07:40 to 10:30). Hand in your luggage here, and it will be delivered to the other end of the Alpine Route \u2013 Toyama Station (must be picked up before 18:00).\n2. Bus Shinano-Omachi \u2013 Ogizawa\u00a0 (40 min)\n3. Trolleybus Ogizawa \u2013 Kurobe Dam\u00a0 (16 min)\nAt Kurobe Dam, we spent some time, maybe about 1,5 hours. We walked around, took pictures, and had a look at the small museum. You can spend less time there or more time. There is also a small ferry cruise on the dam (takes 2,5 hours), but we did not take this.\n4. Cable Car Kurobe Dam \u2013 Kurobedaira\u00a0 (5 min)\nWe did not spend much time at Kurobedaira. We had lunch at a cafe (maybe 30 minutes).\n5. Ropeway Kurobedaira \u2013 Daikanbo (7 min)\nWe did not spend much time at Daikanbo. It is not a big area to walk on; it is just a platform/viewpoint.\n6. Trolleybus Daikanbo \u2013 Murodo (10 min)\nThis is the highest point of the Alpine Route. Now you are really in the mountains and can go for long or short walks. We spent maybe 1,5 hours here altogether. We hiked the Mukurigaike Pond Loop (1 hour). But we did not take a bath in the Onsen at Mukurigaike Inn (which I regret).\nFrom Murodo, you can also climb Mt. Tateyama (it takes about 4 hours).\n7. Bus Murodo \u2013 Bijodaira (50 min)\nWe spent basically no time in Bijodaira, only waiting for the cable car. But you can do walks from Bijodaira too, or jump off the bus on its way from Murodo to Bijodaira to do walks along the way. We did not do this.\n8. Cable Car Bijodaira \u2013 Tateyama (7 min)\nWe spent no time in Tateyama, only waiting for the train. You can choose to end your Alpine Route journey here if you want to sleep in Tateyama. But there is not much to see in Tateyama.\n9. Train Tateyama \u2013 Toyama (1 hour)\nToyama is the end of the Alpine Route and the end of the Alpine Route ticket. Here, we picked up our bags (we picked them up around 17:00, the Baggage Forwarding Office closes at 18:00).\n10. Train Toyama \u2013 Kanazawa (35 min)\nWe chose to go to Kanazawa immediately, and not sleep in Toyama as we had heard that Kanazawa is a nicer city with much more to see. But you can, of course, sleep in Toyama. It is quite a big city. We reached Kanazawa around 18:00/ 6 pm.\nIf you want to do the same, and spend a few days in Kanazawa, check out our ultimate guide to Kanazawa and our recommended places to stay in Kanazawa. Kanazawa quickly became our favorite city in Japan and is a must-visit in our opinion.\nThe only place you can reserve tickets for the Alpine Route is here (the official website of Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route).\nThe ticket is valid for five days after you have exchanged your WEB reservation ticket for an actual ticket at the ticket office (for instance, at Ogizawa Station if you start on the east side or at Tateyama Station if you start on the west side of the route).\nYou can, of course, buy Alpine Route tickets directly at the Ogizawa Station or Tateyama Station (depending on which side you want to start the Alpine Route) without any reservations. But I recommend that you make a ticket reservation if you plan on doing the Alpine Route during the peak seasons of spring (April, May & June) and autumn (September & October).\nWe did the Alpine Route in July and had no problems getting tickets without any reservations. We just showed up at Ogizawa Station (we came from Matsumoto Station to Ogizawa Station) in the morning and bought the ticket at the ticket counter for the same day.\nThe Alpine Route ticket for the full route one-way (East: Shinano Omachi to West: Dentetsu Toyama, or the other way around) costs:\nThe Alpine Route is unfortunately not covered by the JR Pass.\nBut you can use the JR Pass to get to the start of the Alpine Route. You can use the JR Pass to get to Shinano Omachi Station if you want to start on the east side of the Alpine Route or to Dentetsu Toyama Station if you want to start on the west side.\nWe used JR Passes to get from Tokyo (via one night in Matsumoto) to Shinano Omachi Station, where we started our Alpine Route trip.\nSee the fares for the Alpine Route tickets here\nWe did the Alpine Route as a day trip (between Matsumoto and Kanazawa), but doing it over 2-3 days is a great idea. Then you can do more hiking and see more of the stunning mountain landscape. It is also a bit more relaxed, and you can enjoy it more.\nThe best place to stay when doing the Alpine Route over several days is to stay at one of the hotels along the route or at either of the starting points \u2013 Shinano-Omachi Station (east side of the route) or Toyama (west side).\nHotel Tateyama\nHotel Tateyama is a resort hotel located at the highest point of the Alpine Route \u2013 Murodo (see step 6. Murodo in this article), 2 450 meters above sea level. The hotel is at the center of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. The panoramic view of the 3,000-meter mountains surrounding the hotel is stunning! It is an excellent place to go hiking.\nThe hotel has several free tours like a bus tour to see the sunrise from a mountain top, a snow wall walking tour, a star gazing tour, and a bird-watching tour. You also get to borrow snow boots and trekking poles for free. This is the best place to stay if you want to hike Mt. Tateyama.\nThe hotel offers a baggage forwarding service (to and from the hotel) and free lockers where you can leave your belongings after check-out and explore the area. The hotel\u2019s hot spring (onsen) is fantastic; you can even book a private bath. The set dinner is excellent, too, with high-quality food (Japanese and French). The WIFI is quite strong. Staying on top of the mountain is a unique experience!\nClick here for the latest prices\nAnother option is to stay close to where the Alpine Route starts on the east side, close to the JR Shinano-Omachi Station, or on the west side, close to JR Toyama Station. Why not try a Ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) in this area?\nHere are a few nice hotels/ ryokans close to the start of the Alpine Route on the east side \u2013 JR Shinano-Omachi Station:\nThe closing and opening dates for the Alpine Route Tateyama Kurobe are (every year):\nThe Alpine Route is awesome all year round (when it is open), and each season has its highlight:\nWhen the route opens in mid-April, you can see huge and impressive 18-meter-tall snow/ice walls on each side of the road. This melts during April, May, and June and is more or less completely gone in July.\nIn June, spring is on in the mountains with beautiful spring flowers, birds singing, and everything gets green. Even in late June, the snow walls are still over 10 meters high. There will be fewer visitors in June so that you can enjoy a more relaxing experience.\nSummer is the best season for hiking, sightseeing, climbing, and walking in the mountains, as the temperatures are pleasantly warm. There is still some snow at the route\u2019s highest point (Murodo) that you can play around with.\nThe autumn is in September/ October, turning nature into stunning colors of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves take six weeks to change color, and it begins at the end of September.\nThe autumn colors last until the beginning of November. The change begins in higher areas and moves down the mountain. You can see all kinds of colors and white snow-covered mountain peaks during a trip. Stunning!\nThe Tatekyama Kurobe Alpine Route takes at least six to seven hours, depending on the wait for transport and how much hiking you want to do.\nWe used nine hours all together from Matsumoto to Kanazawa:\nWe spent the exact same amount of time on transport and on walking/ waiting for transport.\nYou can do the Alpine Route from east to west or west to east.\nFrom east to west: Take the train to Shinano Omachi Station\u00a0from either Nagano Station (a 1 2,5 hour train ride) or Matsumoto Station (a 1-hour train ride).\nFrom west to east: Take the train to Toyama Station.\nWe dropped off our luggage at the Baggage Forwarding Service counter at the Shinano-Omachi Station, also called \u201cAlps Roman Kan\u201d (located just next to JR Shinano Omachi Station).\nDrop-off time is between 07:40 and 10:30 am; no reservation is needed. You are given a baggage forwarding tag that you fill out and attach to your luggage, and it will be delivered to the Alpine Route\u2019s end stop \u2013 Toyama Station.\nYour bags can be reclaimed at Toyama train station between 15:30 (3:30 pm) and 18:00 (6 pm). The cost per bag is 2500 JPY from Shinano Omachi Station to Toyama Station.\nYou can also have your luggage shipped directly from your hotel to the next hotel you plan to stay at. Read more about that here.\nObs! In 2023, the forwarding service ended on 31. October. So, if you plan on doing the Alpine Route in November, you should check if the baggage forwarding service is still operative.\nIt is possible only to do parts of this trip and also do it the other way around. You can get more information about this trip on the Alpine Route webpage: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/\n\u21d2We love the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route, and it is on our recommended two-week Japan Itinerary, which you can find here\nUnfortunately, you cannot see Mount Fuji on this alpine route. If seeing Mt Fuji is on your bucket list, you should consider visiting Hakone and/ or Fuji Five Lakes, which are close to Tokyo (1,5 \u2013 2 hours train ride).\nPIN IT FOR LATER!\nHover over the pictures below, and press the red \u201cSAVE\u201d button that pops up:\nPin\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPin\nPin\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPin\nIs the Japanese Alpine Route something you can picture yourself doing?

What beautiful looking territory. Never even knew that Japan had their own version of the Alps. The trip looks fantastic. Thanks guys for continuing to share your adventures, much appreciated!\nThanks James! It really was a great mountain trip! Incredibly green and lush, even above 2000 m. Back home in Norway nothing grows at this heights, only grey rocks.\nIf I ever make it to Japan, I would love to do this hike! The views look incredible! Definitely appears that all that jumping on and off various forms of transportation was worth it.\nI loved learning about the dam. Now I want to watch that movie!\nWe also want to watch the film. Will try to find it, but it is probably only in Japanese though. The dam was such a gigantic building project, in very harsh conditions. So the film is probably pretty dramatic.\nWow! What a hike but Whoa! Very worthwhile. \ud83d\ude00\nYeah it really was a great journey, with breathtaking views! \ud83d\ude42\nWow! What a spectacular adventure. The water color at the Kurobe Dam and the rapid water would be worth the trip, even without the rest of the amazing scenes. How wonderful to be somewhere so clean you can drink the natural flowing water.\nWe loved this trip Rhonda! I know, the water in the Kurobe Dam was so turquoise, it was almost magic! \ud83d\ude42\nThe water in that small river was really cold and refreshing. Back home in Norway the water is also so clean that we can drink from all the rivers and lakes, as well as the tap. Very nice to be able to do that again. Nothing beats fresh clean flowing water from the rivers!\nHi. Looks like a great day out in the mountains.\nHow much of the day did you spend walking and how much was transportation? And what was the final costs for the hike? Did you take a bath in the onseen? If so, how was it?\nHi. It looks like an amazing hike. We are going to japan in april, and this is now something we will have to consider. When did you go? How much of the time were you walking compared to time spent on transport?\nHi Elisabeth!\nWe did the Alpine Route in the end of July. As you can see in this post it was raining when we started out from Ogizawa, but it got better and better and in the end we even got sun. \ud83d\ude42 It was a bit cold at the top even in July, so I bet it is even colder in April so bring warm clothes and good shoes. It might also be some snow up in there in April.\nAltogether we did this trip in 9 hours (8 am \u2013 5 pm), but it all depends on how much time you want to spend at each place of this trip, and how much you want to walk around on each place and at the top (Murodo).\nWhen you get to the top at Murodo, you can choose to go on a long hike for hours or even days and weeks around the mountains in the area (there are several mountain huts where you can sleep and eat). Or you can choose just a short walk like we did. We did the Mikurigaike Pond Loop hike (took about 1 hour altogether). At the Mikurigaike Inn you can take a bath in the Onsen, but we did not do it (did not have the time, and it was a lot of people and very crowded). We took Onsen several other places in Japan during our trip. Onsen was great, you definitely should try it somewhere in Japan! So you can easily spend more time at the top in Murodo than we did if you want.\nBut you can do this trip in less than 9 hours too, maybe as short as 6 hour, if you don`t want to walk around. The baggage pickup office in Toyama close close at 6 pm., so you have to time it so you get to Toyama by then.\nHave updated this article with the info you asked about, like how much time did we spend on the transportation and walking, how much money did we spend and so on. It is under \u201cConclusion/ Summary\u201d.\nWe really recommend this trip if you want to see some of the Japan Alps. This is probably the most \u201ccompact\u201d alpine trip that you can get in Japan in one day. You get to see a lot of the alps in a short time! You can read more about this Journey here: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/\nHave a great trip to Japan in April! I am sure you will love it there! It is such a great country with amazing food! Read more about what food you should try here: https://nerdnomads.com/japanese-food.\nI have written more blog posts from Japan, both from Matsumoto and Kanazawa where we started and ended our Alpine Journey, that will be published in the upcoming weeks. So stay tuned! \ud83d\ude42\nMaria, What fun! I love the greens, and I\u2019ll bet it was a nice respite from the Tokyo heat and humidity. I love all the different types of transportation you had to take as well.\nYeah, it was so refreshing to get up in the mountains after spending a week in Tokyo! Felt like we could breathe again! \ud83d\ude42 All the different transportation was half the fun of the trip! The tunnels were quite impressive.\nSounds like an amazing trip! I didn\u2019t even know there was such thing as the Japan Alps. I can\u2019t believe how cute the trolleybus is, and what amazing views from the top of the dam! A great day out.\nThe Japan Alps is great both summer and winter! The skiing is supposed to be excellent with lots of powder snow and there are many skiing resorts in the area. I really want to go back in the winter season, as I love skiing. \ud83d\ude42 It sure was a great day out Margherita, with tons of lovely fresh air!\nBeautiful place\u2026\nYeah the Japan Alps really is a beautiful place Muza-chan. \ud83d\ude42\nWhat an awesome experience this must have been! I have never been to Japan but you have me sold after reading this post. Never knew anything about the Japanese Alps but honestly they look comparable to the Alps we all know in Europe!\nWe have a lot of mountains where we live in Norway, but the Japan Alps really amazed us! I will absolutely say that they are comparable to the European Alps Chris, just as high and spectacular, with great skiing/ snowboarding during winter.\nWhat a wonderful way to see Japan, especially in contrast to all those big, congested cities you had been in. I\u2019ve been to Mt. Fuji and Hakone, but I did not get a chance to see the route you took. It\u2019s so beautiful, and that dam is mighty impressive. Good tip about paying attention to the time so that you can make it back to pick up your luggage.\nLucky you that have been to Mt Fuji, Michele! We so wanted to go to Hakone and see Mt Fuji, but I got sick and the weather was really bad, so unfortunately we had to cancel it. So glad we got to do this trip in the Japan Alps though, it was definitely one of the highlights of our Japan trip!\nWOW! I\u2019m blown away by all the pictures, from the dam (that is one impressive dam!) to the ropeway ride views, to Mikurigaike Pond. Thanks for sharing such a detailed post! I mayyyyy be in Tokyo next May, and would love to get out of the city and into the mountains. But looking at all the transportation you took is making my head hurt, lol! I\u2019m going to pin this just in case though. \ud83d\ude42\nHehe, yeah it was a lot of transportation Anna, but it was very easy and just to follow everybody else. You can`t get lost or miss the transportation. The transportation was no hassle really, it was actually half the fun! \ud83d\ude42\nLucky you that may be in Tokyo next May! It is such a great city, one of my favorites! Thanks for the pin Anna! \ud83d\ude42\nWow! What a cool sounding day! I think I would definitely want to do something like this. Thanks for sharing!\nThanks Adelina! It sure was a super cool trip! \ud83d\ude42\nWhat a comprehensive post. There is nothing left unturned. You should be really proud of that effort = and those photos! Big thanks for linking up with us for #SundayTraveler\nThank you so much SJ! Hehe, yeah it was a lot of work writing this post. It became a bit too long in the end, but I really wanted it to be informative in case some of our readers want to do the same trip. We had a hard time figuring everything out and finding information before we did this journey. \ud83d\ude42 Thanks for hosting the #SundayTraveler, it is such a great linkup!\nOh wow. Now I want to go there.\nHehe, happy to hear that Dan! I guess that means we have done something right \ud83d\ude42\nHi, Its great to find this post. I will go with my friends in April but there is something that is bugging me the most.\nDid you bought the tickets to the alps on the day of ur journey itself? Or you bought it earlier? I am afraid there is such thing as ticket sold out or whatsoever. Thanks ^^\nHi Masmona,\nWe bought the tickets the same day as the journey. We just went to the ticket office in the morning, and shortly after started the journey. But if you worry that it might get sold out, you should make a ticket reservation at their webpage: http://www.alpen-route.com/ticket/en/information.html. The full route opens again 16th of April.\nHave a great trip! I`m sure you will love it! \ud83d\ude42\nThanks so much for this post. I plan to do this trip in a fortnight and you have answered every question I had. Much appreciated. I will now browse the rest of your site as it is sure to be equally helpful!\nSo happy to hear that our post could be of help to you Wendy! Hope you will enjoy this alpine route as much as we did, have an awesome trip!\nMaria, thank you very much for your wonderful report. I\u2019m a Japanese woman born, bred and live in Tokyo. Tateyama is one of my favorite places for photo shooting. You took exactly the same route as I took three years ago. Kurobe dam is very impressive and so are the various kinds of transportation. The route is interesting if you don\u2019t have to bring your camera equipment! However I\u2019m determined to take the route from Toyama side next time, especially now the new bullet train operates from Tokyo. From Toyama you can take a bus that brings you straight up to Murodo. What a pity it was only a day trip. Even if you don\u2019t go mountaineering, at least an overnight stay would have been an awesome experience. You will be able to see an ermine or two, or Japanese Ptarmigans, our special national ttreasure. Oh, and if you are lucky, stars reflected on Mikuriga Pond!\nHi Miyoko Ito,\nThank you so much for your nice and informative comment! We really want to come back and do this route again, and next time we will definitely bring our mountain gear from back home and do some more mountain climbing and stay overnight at the lovely cabins along the way. And of course, take Onsen. We fell in love with this area, so beautiful and peaceful with lovely fresh air. We do a lot of mountain walking and climbing back home in Norway, both summer and wintertime. We plan to visit Japan in wintertime, to go skiing in the Nagano area.\nWould love to see Japanese Ptarmigans! We have Willow Ptarmigans here in Norway, they are so beautiful and taste delicious too. \ud83d\ude42 Stars reflecting on the Mikuriga Pond sounds amazing!\nCheers,\nMaria\nHi Maria, thanks for such an informative post and the pictures are stunning. I\u2019m heading to Japan next week and was thinking of doing this tour, although I know the conditions will be different in November. I\u2019m keen on doing this from Tokyo and perhaps spending the night. Any recommendations? Thank you! Cheers, Nikita.\nHi Nikita,\nThank you so much! Happy to hear that you like our post! \ud83d\ude42\nLucky you who are heading to Japan next week, you will love it!\nWe went from Tokyo to Matsumoto (about 4 hours with train), and stayed the night at Richmond Hotel. We started on the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route early the next morning.\nAfter the Alpine Route, we went straight to Kanazawa City where we stayed at Hotel Trusty, a stunning hotel with perfect location!\nThere are some accommodation options up in the mountains too, they are all listed here: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/information/accommodation.html\nHave a great trip to Japan, and have fun doing the Alpine Route! I`m sure it is absolutely breathtaking in October, with the autumn colors and everything. Just bring some warm clothes as it might be cold up there this time of year.\nCheers,\nMaria\nHey Maria, Thanks for showing us this wonderful regions in Japan.\nI will be visiting Japan next month. Would you suggest me to visit Alps route in Nov (~20Nov) ? Will it be worthy?\nHi UltraWideLife,\nWe took this route in the end of July, but I`m sure it will be spectacular also at wintertime in November with snow covered mountains. The temperature will drop below zero in November, so bring warm clothes, gloves and a hat, and waterproof winter boots. Be aware that the route closes 1st of December, so 30th of November is the last day it is open. Updated information about the route can be found here: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/.\nHave a great trip to Japan next month! I`m sure you will love it!\nCheers,\nMaria\nMaria, we have recently returned from a trip to Japan where we also took the opportunity to get some \u2018mountain time\u2019 by going on the Tateyama Kurobe Alipine Route in October. We stayed in the town of Shinano Omachi for two nights in a Ryoken near the train station. We planned to only do half the route by going to Murodo and return, and as a result of getting an early start (we caught the 7am bus) we were able to take our time. The weather was absolutely perfect and we had a great day out. Similar to you we caught the bus, then all of the different forms of transport up to Murodo \u2013 our kids absolutely loved it!\nWe did the walk around Kurobe Dam which had a huge amount of water being released, and really enjoyed seeing the fall foliage colours when we took the ropeway. At Murodo we did the walk around the lake and got to see (and smell!) Hell Valley. It was fascinating to see such a volcanic area at the top of the mountain range!\nWe were able to take our time to do the walk and then we started the long route back down the mountain, arriving back at our Ryokan by around 4pm, with enough time to enjoy the Ryokan hot baths before a lovely dinner. Overall it was a fantastic day out and I was really pleased that the weather was perfect for our big day and that we didn\u2019t need to use our \u2018back up day\u2019 option.\nI think if you plan to visit that it is really important to be able to plan your itinerary so you only have a single day that you can possibly do the trip \u2013 just like in any mountain area flexibility is important. Also, be aware that there are several accommodation options up on the mountain (and lockers at the various stops) so if you want to take more time to explore you can do the trip across multiple days.\nHi Anne,\nWow, you really had a great time doing the Alpine Route! Great to hear that also kids like this kind of adventure and walks. Lucky you who got to see this area in fall colors. It was still summer when we visited, although the temperature was low up in the mountains.\nThe Kurobe Dam is really impressive! All that water! We have pretty big dams here in Norway too, producing electricity, but nothing compared to this in size and location.\nWe did not know that it was possible to spend the night up in the mountains. If we had we would definitely have stayed at one of the mountains hotels up there so that we could do more hikes. We wanted to take onsen/ hot springs at Mikurigaike Inn (Japans highest Onsen), but unfortunately, we did not have time as we had to catch the next transportation.\nWe are planning to head back to this mountain area to do some more hiking over several days, maybe even a week.\nThanks for commenting Anne, and giving additional travel tips regarding the Alpine Route! Really appreciate it!\nCheers,\nMaria\nMaria, when I plan a trip I always have to deal with the dilemma in trying to fit in as much as possible without over doing it. These days I usually (but not always\u2026) do a better job of planning a bit more time in each location so that we don\u2019t need to rush around quite as much.\nI try to spend enough time researching the options to work out how much time I need to allow, and for this trip I was definitely concerned about whether the weather would play nice which is why we ended up staying for 2 nights at the bottom of the mountain in Shinano Omachi so that we could have some options. When we didn\u2019t need to use our back up day we caught the earlier bus to Nagano and had enough time to visit the main temple in Nagano (which was fabulous by the way) before picking up our hire car. It wasn\u2019t planned but ended up being a great option to do some more exploration which I had not planned.\nHi dear,\nam soooo thankful I chanced upon your blog post. Am still a little uncertain. Does the alpine option ticket allow me to take the different modes of transport (cable car, bus, trains) from Nagano to Toyama?\nTIA! \ud83d\ude42 Keep up the geat posts by the way!\nHi Michelle,\nYes, the Alpine Route ticket allows you use all the different transportations on the Alpine Route (bus cable car, train and so on are included in the ticket). The ticket is from Ogizawa to Toyama. So you would have to take the train from Nagano to Ogizawa first, which is not inlcuded in the Alpine Route ticket.\nYou can read more about the ticket options at their webpage: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/\nHave a great time doing the Alpine Route, you will love it! Hope you get nice weather! \ud83d\ude42\n-Maria-\nThank you for sharing your adventure and details especially including your time spent in each section as we are planning to do something very similar and are a little concerned about the timing to make sure we can pick up our bags before closing! \ud83d\ude42\nWhich leads me to my question, since it seems like there is no way to contact the alpine route people, baggage service, or even hotel to ask them except via phone. When you dropped off your bags, besides the train station are there other places you can request to have your bags delivered to? I know on their site it lists hotels with which you can drop your bags to have transported but wanted to know if we can drop it off at the Shinano-Omachi station and have it delivered to the hotel we\u2019re staying at in Toyama. Any advice/info would be greatly appreciated! Hao\nHi Hao,\nWe were a bit concerned too about not being able to reach the baggage office at Toyama train station before it closed at 6 p.m. But we managed to get there before closing time.\nOn their web page: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/transport_new/baggage.html they list several hotels in Toyama where you can have your baggage delivered (from 4 p.m.):\n[Toyama City]\nToyama-Chitetsu Hotel / Toyoko Inn Toyama-Ekimae1 / Toyama Dai-ichi Hotel / Toyama Excel Hotel Tokyu / Canal Park Hotel Toyama / Toyama Manten Hotel / APA Hotel Toyama / Hotel Dormy Inn Toyama / ANA Crowne Plaza Toyama / Hotel Grand Terrace Toyama / Daiwa Roynet Hotels Toyama / Comfort Hotel Toyama Ekimae / Hotel Route-INN Toyama Ekimae\n[Unazuki Onsen] Unazuki Kokusai Hotel / Unazuki Suginoi Hotel / Unazuki Grand Hotel / Hotel Togen / Enraku / Hotel Kurobe / Entaijiso / Green Hotel Kisen / San Yanagitei / Feel Unazuki\nYou should probably contact one of these hotels in advanced, and ask if they have this service available and order it before you book a room there.\nHave a great trip doing the Japan Alpine Route! You will love it!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria! I love your posts! Is it required to leave your bags before doing the Alpine Route? I assume that the starting point is different from the ending point.\nHi Ginelle,\nNo, it is not required to leave your bags, it is just a service that they provide so that you don`t have to carry big bags on this whole trip. But you can bring your bag/ backpack along with you if you want. Some of these transportations can be crowded, however, and there are some walking so big bags are not so convenient.\nThe starting point (Shinano-Omachi) is different from the ending point (Toyama).\nThis is a great way to see some of the mountain areas of Japan, and get some fresh mountain air. \ud83d\ude42\n-Maria-\nI was so confused regarding this day trip- until I read your blog! Thank you for the many small details and tips, I can now do this trail at ease (Noa from Israel). (:\nHi Noa,\nAwww, thank you! So happy that our blog could clarify things and help you plan your trip to the Japanese alps.\nHave an awesome trip into the mountains and enjoy the fresh air! You will love it! Just remember to bring some warm clothes, as it gets pretty chilly up there.\n-Maria-\nWonderful post. I referred your blog and visited this route in April. I visited on the day, Snow corridor was opened. And even witnessed the opening ceremony by state officials. I totally loved walking on the snow fields of tengudiera and snow corridors of Murodo.\nThanks, Ankur! Wow, the snow corridor looks awesome! Very cool! Would love to go back to this part of Japan and do some skiing.\n-Maria-\nHello! Love your 2 week itinerary. I leave with my bf on Friday for our own 2 week adventure. For the Alpine route, do you recommend reserving buses ahead of time?\nHi Marian,\nThank you so much! Wow, lucky you who are heading to Japan on a two-week trip! You will love this beautiful country!\nWe did not reserve buses for the Alpine route and had no problem getting tickets. None of the buses were full.\nHave a great trip to Japan! Happy travels!\nCheers,\nMaria\nThanks Maria for your vivid description.\nSeeking your advice and opinion. We are desiring to take our Mother to the Alpine Route \u2013 Ogizawa to Tateyama. The difficult area is the 220 steps to the Obs. Point. Can that be bypassed. She will manage to cross the dam, walking slowly. Are there any other areas in the course which require attention. Our travel time being April 2017 (after the 16th). Thanks.\nHi Dushyant,\nAs for the Kurobe Dam, you don`t have to go up the 220 steps to the observation deck, this is just an extra walk for those who want to get higher up to take photos. You can just stay down at the trolley-bus station, and walk over the dam on the flat pathway (no stairs) till the next train station. This is a short walk. You will still have beautiful views of the dam and its surroundings. No need to go up to the Observation Deck.\nThe only places you have to walk a few stairs are at the train and cable car stations, but there are not many steps. So I would say that your mother will manage to do this trip perfectly. You don`t have to walk much if you don`t want to or manage. You will see lots of beautiful nature from each transportation (train, bus and cable cars) and can do short walks just around each station on flat terrain.\nAt the web page for this trip, they write: \u201cWheelchair users and those concerned about walking have no need to worry. When negotiating the stairs and vehicles at each station, please feel free to contact a member of staff for assistance.\u201d\nhttp://www.kanko-omachi.gr.jp/en/alpen_route/plan#p09\nI`m sure you and your mother will have a great trip into the Japanese Alps, it is truly a spectacular trip with amazing views. You will love it!\nHave a great trip to Japan!\nBest regards,\nMaria\nDear Espen and Maria\nThank you for your very informative \u201dBlog\u201d ( better than that ).\nI have emailed you before and got a answer, this when I first started thinking/planning ( no did not have a plan till I read your Blog) Then I used your Idea\u2019s to plan our trip.\nSo its 4 night Tokyo, 3 days. Nikko, 1 night, 1 night Nagano.\nYes the Alpine Route. 2 nights Kanazawa, 3 night Kyoto\n1 night Osaka. .fly from there back to Thailand.\nT would have been lost without your information. Just re read your Alpine route again. I was not able to get that info anywhere else. I could not go Matsumoto etc .All hotels are Full?? this seems crazy for 11 months in advance? So unable to get in your recommended Hotels sob sob ( they look good) I think too many are reading and booking from your \u201cBlog\u201d.\nThanks again for your brilliant Blog/ stories\nPS may still come back for other fill in info.\nBest Regards\nBarry\nHi Barry,\nThank you so much! Glad we could be of help and that our blog is an inspiration and provides you with useful information when planning your Japan trip.\nHmm, very strange that all hotels in Japan are full! I think that it is actually too early to book hotels now. That they have not opened up for booking for October 2017 yet, that`s why you get \u201cnot available\u201d. On TripAdvisor.com this it the case at least, I can`t find any hotels for October 2017 because it is too early (the dates for October 2017 are all greyed out). So you should try again later, maybe after New Year. I`m sure you will find some hotels in Japan later on.\nDon`t hesitate to ask us any further questions. Happy travels!\nBest regards,\nMaria\nMatsumoto to Shinano-Omachi makes sense to me, but how to I get back from your end spot back to Matsumoto. My issue is that my husband and I have two large check bags and I wanted to do this leg of the trip but I also wanted to start my day early. How did you guys fit the hotel check in with this leg of the trip?\nMaria,\nThank you so much for posting, I love your articles \ud83d\ude42 They inspire me! I\u2019ve traveled a lot over the years and your writing keeps me going, its so nice to read about your adventures. I\u2019ve been researching the Tateyama-Kurobe alpine pass for days now and this is the most helpful information that I have come across! You have answered all my questions and more. Can\u2019t wait to breath that mountain air!\nAll the best!\nSafe and happy travels \ud83d\ude42\nAmanda\nHi Amanda,\nThank you so much for your nice comment! It made my day!\nLucky you who are going on the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route! It is such a lovely trip, you will love it.\nHave an amazing trip in the alps!\n-Maria-\nLovely! We are planning to do this tomorrow from Kanazawa.. where did u go for the hot spring though? \ud83d\ude42\nHi Vidya,\nWow, cool that you are doing the Alpine Route tomorrow! Hope you get nice weather! The full route doesn`t open until 15th of April, only the partial route is open now (10. \u2013 14. April): http://www.alpen-route.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/route.jpg\nThe hot spring, which is Japans highest hot spring at 2450 m, is located at the Mukurigaike Inn, next to the Mikurigaike Pound. This is a nice walk from the Murodo stop which is the highest stop on the Alpine Route. This part of the route opens 15th of April, so you will not be able to reach this tomorrow, unfortunately.\nHave a nice time on the Alpine Route!\n-Maria-\nWe did the Alpine Route yesterday and it was amazing,\nSo glad we did it. Your itinary was so accurate. Thank you. Amazing views. You think you had just seen the best one and you go up a bit higher and it gets better and better. Our weather was completely different, bright blue skies all day but so much snow. Still lots to see and experience.\nHi Rachel,\nWow, sounds like you had the best weather and a great trip! So happy to hear that you found our description and tips on the Alpine Route useful!\nThank you so much for commenting back and telling us about your trip! Really appreciate it!\nCheers!\n-Maria-\nHi! I just wanted to say thanks for this blog post \u2013 it helped me plan my alpine route trip =)\nThank you sooooo much, Meeta! Really happy to hear that our article could be of help to you when planning your Alpine Route trip!\nThanks for commenting! Have an amazing Alpine Route trip (if you have not been yet)!!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria,\nSo glad I came across your website.\nFinally found an itinenary of the places we wanted to visit in October.\nThe Japan Alps\u2026that would be an adventure for us!\nWe\u2019re in our 50s and 60s. I think we\u2019ll do some hiking training before we go.\nMy hubby thought I was crazy when I said 9 hours trip.\nThen he was excited when I said not hiking for 9 hours. Hiking just to observation decks and to the Pond\u2026 rest is bus, cable cars, etc\u2026 Something different.\nHi Chris,\nSo cool that you are going to Japan and have found some inspiration from our itinerary! The Alpine Route is an amazing trip, and the good thing is that everyone can do it! It is as you say not much walking involved unless you really want to. Bring some warm wind-proof clothes as it can be a bit chilly up in the mountains. A beanie, scarf, and gloves can be nice too, especially in October.\nHave a great trip to Japan, and enjoy the Alpine Route! I`m sure you will love it! The autumn colors are beautiful in October.\n-Maria-\nI love the Nomad Nerds and their info. I have been following in your footsteps all through Japan and so many of your comments inspired my destinations. I need more than time in the amazing country. Thank you.\nHi Gillian!\nWooooow, thank you for your awesome comment! It really made my day! \ud83d\ude42\nSo cool that we could inspire you to visit these places in Japan! Japan is as you say an amazing country! Hope to be back one day.\nThanks again for commenting! Happy travels!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria, I\u2019m going to Japan in a few weeks and am really looking forward to the Alpine route. I was wondering how tough the walk was. My boyfriend has breathing issues so we can\u2019t do any hikes that are steep or involve a lot of stairs. Do you have any recommendations for us? Best wishes and thanks for sharing your experiences!\nHi Liz,\nThe Alpine route is very easy and does not involve much walking or climbing. You basically take different sorts of transport up and down the mountain; cable car, trains, trams, bus and so on. So I think your boyfriend will be able to do this route just fine. We did some walking because we wanted to, but it is not mandatory.\nYou can turn around any time and just go back down again if it gets too much for your boyfriend.\nHave a great trip to Japan and enjoy the Alpine route!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria, this route sounds like an adventure! Do you have any recommendations on how to do this route or a similar experience in the region to see the mountains by car and/or longer hike?\nHi Mia,\nThank you! The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route is amazing!\nHmmm, sorry I don`t have any tips on similar experiences in this region by car or hikes. But you can do short or long hikes in the mountains along this route, there are some cabins/ alpine hotels along this route that you can walk to and spend the night. Here are some of the trekking courses you can do: http://www.alpen-route.com/en/courses/suggested.html\nHave a great hiking trip in the Japanese Alps!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria, we did this yesterday! It was raining and very very cloudy but Kurobe was sunny!! We spent time at the Onsen which was great and highly recommended. We planned our trip a few months ago and followed many of your suggestions (e.g. Tokyo, Matsumoto, Nikko and soon Kyoto) which have been fantastically helpful. On the Alpine route we would have liked to have seen the waterfall but simply ran out of time. A piece of advice to anyone doing this journey is to keep a close eye on timetables. I don\u2019t think it is possible to see / do everything in the guide that it provided so pick what you want to do. Overall a long but fantastic day. Alan & Jane\nHi Alan,\nWow, awesome!! Sounds like you had a great day! We did not have time to take Onsen, unfortunately, sounds lovely! Will consider staying at the ryokan if we do this alpine round trip again. Have a great time in Kyoto!\n-Maria-\nYes my concern is too if there are any delays re picking up bags but if can be dropped ay a hotel that eases my worry. Also wanted to thank you for writing such informative replys to everyone.\nThanks Maria for this very helpful and detailed narrative of your trip to the Alpine Route. This gives me great ideas as I plan a visit to this place soon!\nHi Arnel,\nThank you so much! So glad to hear that our article about the Alpine Route could be of inspiration and help to you! This part of Japan is breathtaking and doing this Alpine Route was my favorite part of our Japan trip. You have something to look forward to! I\u00b4m sure you will love it too!\nHave a great trip to Japan!\n-Maria-\nHi maria, how many JR pass(s) did you buy? I mean, can two travelers use the same pass or we should purchase two passes ?\nMany thanks on your amazing work \ud83d\ude42\nHi Bassil,\nThank you so much! You must buy one JR Pass per person. The pass is personal and only one person can use it. So we had two passes. \ud83d\ude42\n-Maria-\nI just wanted to say thank you for your post on the Alpine route. I just finished it a couple of days ago and all of your comments are spot on. If you follow it exactly the way you described you will have an awesome time! Can\u2019t say thank you enough for your post.\nHi Paul,\nWow, thank you soooo much for your comment! Your nice words really made my day! \ud83d\ude42 Appreciate it! You are awesome! \ud83d\ude42\nAll the best,\nMaria\nWow wow wow\nIt just sound amazing and I can\u2019t wait to do it on my upcoming trip next month, not cheap though \ud83d\ude41\nBut what happen to the ice wall? See no photo of you posting it. Thought that part is the star of the whole trip.\nHi Brad,\nLucky you who are doing the Alpine Route next month! It is a fantastic trip with amazing views!\nWe did this route in July, and the snow and ice wall had melted. The Alpine Route is closed during winter, between 1st of December and mid-April. The ice/ snow wall is only there when the route opens in mid-April. Then it melts during April/ May and is completely gone in June. So I`m afraid that you will not see the ice/snow wall in November either.\nHave a great trip to Japan and enjoy the Alpine Route!!\n-Maria-\nJust wanted to thank you for your very detailed and helpful blog. We recently did the Alpine Route and found it was our favourite part of our trip to Japan. It is definitely not well advertised because most of the foreign tourists (and even some locals) we met hadn\u2019t heard about it so we were glad to stumble upon your blog.\nHi Robyn,\nThank you so much! Wow, so happy to hear that you enjoyed the Alpine Route and that you found our blog useful! It is one of my absolute favorite things to do in Japan too! We plan on doing the Alpine Route again in October/ November, looking forward to seeing the beautiful landscape in autumn colors.\nThanks for commenting! Really appreciate it!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria,\nI tried to book myself the Alpine Tour for the 6th of November. I was told that starting 4th November they do not do full tour from Omachi to Tateyama. Also the luggage delivery service stops on the 4th of November.\nI just wanted to know if this is the only official agents that do this trip or can I book it from somewhere else too? Your help will be appreciated\nHi Sachin,\nThe full Alpine Route is open until the 30th of November.\nBaggage Forwarding Service\nYou are right, the Baggage Forwarding Service seems to be closing earlier than the Alpine Route.\nThe Baggage Forwarding Service where you hand in your bags by yourself at the baggage forwarding service center at Shinano-Omachi Station (we did this) is only open until the 10th of November. No reservation is required. Drop-off time is between 08:00 and 11:10. At the end of the Alpine Route, you can pick up your bags at Toyama Station between 15:30 and 18:00.\nThe Baggage Forwarding Service where they pick up bags at hotels in Tateyama and Midagahara, plus from Toyama Station to Nagano Station is only available until the 4th of November.\nThis is what is written at the official website of the Alpine Route:\nService available: April 15th \u2013 November 10th.\nHotel Tateyama & Midagahara Hotel: April 29th \u2013 November 4th.\nDentetsu Toyama\uff0dNagano Station: April 15th \u2013 November 4th.(4/15-11/4)\nWhere To Book Alpine Route Tickets Online\nThe only place you can reserve Alpine Route tickets is at the official Alpine Route Webpage. But there are several tour agents that arrange tours where the Alpine Route is included (see a list further down).\nI see that for November 2019 (the last square at the bottom of this page labeled \u201c2019/ 11\u201d) almost all dates are yellow. This means that you can only reserve tickets from Ogizawa and board the Alpine Route in Ogizawa on the east side of the Alpine Route. So you can only do the Alpine Route from the east (starting in Ogizawa) to the west (ending in Tateyama). And not the other way around, from Tateyama (west) to Ogizawa (east).\nWe did the Alpine Route from east to west (from Ogizawa to Tateyama) and it was great!\nI see that there are lots of tickets available for the 6th of November, the date you want to do the Alpine Route, all departing times on this date are available.\nSo you must get to Shinano-Omachi Station (for instance by train from Tokyo to Matsumoto, and then from Matsumoto to Shinano-Omachi). At Shinano-Omachi Station you drop off your bags at the Baggage Forwarding Service Office and buy a bus ticket to Ogizawa (which is not included in the Alpine Route Ticket). This bus ride takes about 40 min.\nIn Ogizawa the Alpine Route starts. Here you exchange your web ticket reservation into an actual ticket at the ticket office. Or you can buy the tickets there directly (we bought ours there and did not make a web reservation).\nSo you must do the Alpine Route from East to West:\nShinano-Omachi Station (hand in your bags) \u2013 Ogizawa (the official start of the Alpine Route) \u2013 Tateyama (the official end of the Alpine Route) \u2013 Toyama (pick up your bags)\nAlpine Route Tours\nSeveral travel agents arrange and sell tours where the Alpine Route is included. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about transportations or tickets as it is all included in the tour:\nVoyagin:\n\u2013 2-Days Tateyama Alpine Route + Takayama + Shirakawa-go village \u2013 Bus tour starts and ends in Tokyo\nViator:\n\u2013 Day tour Alpine Route with an English-speaking guide\n\u2013 2-Days Tateyama Alpine Route + Takayama + Shirakawa-go village \u2013 Bus tour, round-trip from Tokyo\n\u2013 2-Days Tateyama Alpine Route + Kamikochi + Shirakawa-go \u2013 By express train and bus, round-trip from Tokyo\n\u2013 Day tour from Nagano: Snow wall of Alpine Route \u2013 Only available in May and June\nHave a great Alpine Route trip! I\u2019m sure it will work out fine with getting tickets. November is not the peak season of the Alpine Route.\n-Maria-\nHello Maria,\nWe would like to do this for 2 days, where do you suggest we stay overnight. The reason we want to do this for 2 days is to enjoy it at a slower pace and do some more walking / hiking. We will probably start this from the same place as you did. We will also visit the Shirakawa-go village after this one (can be done on the 3rd day) Also, can we pick up our bags the next day or do they have to be picked up on the same day?\nThank you.\nHi Mehmet,\nYou could, for instance, stay right in the middle of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route, in the alps. There are two nice hotels along the route:\n\u2013 Midagahara Hotel\n\u2013 Hotel Tateyama\nOr you can stay close to where the Alpine Route starts on the east side, close to the JR Shinano-Omachi Station. Staying close to the JR Shinano-Omachi Station will make it easy and convenient when doing the Alpine Route over 2 days. Why not try a Ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) in this area? Here are a few nice hotels/ ryokans close to the start of the Alpine Route (east side):\n\u2013 Hotel Yume-no-yu (12-min drive from JR Shinano-Omachi Station)\n\u2013 Kurobe View Hotel (20-min bus trip from JR Shinano-Omachi Station)\n\u2013 Hotel Keisui (15-min drive from JR Shinano-Omachi Station)\nYou can ask the hotel to help you with baggage forwarding to your next hotel.\nHave a fantastic time doing the Alpine Route! Good idea to do it over 2 days, much more relaxed and you can do more hiking and see more of the stunning landscape. We plan on doing that too on our Japan trip next month.\n-Maria-\nThank you for taking the effort to put this together \u2013 my friends and I followed this every step of the way! \ud83d\ude42\nThe only one change (positive one!) when we went in October 2019, was that you can now pick up your luggage at Toyoma station till upto 8pm \ud83d\ude42 Thats a couple of extra hours you can spend walking around the fantastic trails that this route has to offer!\nHi Ashwin,\nThank you so much!! Awesome to hear that you and your friends follow my guide to the Alpine Route! ????\u2764\ufe0f\nThanks for the info on the pick-up luggage office at Toyama Station, that it has extended its opening hours and is now open until 8 pm. That is great! It was a bit stressful for us having to reach it by 6 pm. \ud83d\ude42 I will update my guide.\nThanks for commenting! Really appreciate it!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nMaria, we owe you many thanks.\nDiscovered your blog while preparing our trip to Japan. We didn\u2019t have much time and we don\u2019t like to rush so it was easy to decide to leave places out.\nAfter reading what you wrote about the Alpine route and Kanazawa we included them in the plan. It was October, the leaves were changing colors,we got the brightest day possible. No snow of course but we got to see the alpine garden in Daikanbo, with a collection of Alpine plants. Walking on Mount Murodo was lovely, though the smell of sulfur from all the gas was very strong.\nLuggage wise we sent the stuff from Tokyo to our Kanazawa hotel, so in Matsumoto we had only a light overnight bag, and we didn\u2019t have to bother with the sending-receiving part during the day.\nThanks again\nHi Michal,\nThank you soooo much!!! I love getting feedback from our readers, it means a lot!\nIt sounds like have a fantastic trip on the Alpine Route!! We are actually on our way to Japan right now, will get to Tokyo tomorrow. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we have time to do the Alpine Route on this trip as the route closes on the 30th of November. But next time\u2026.\nThanks for commenting! Really appreciate it!\n-Maria-\nhi Maria.. i just read that \u2018A partial route is open from the 10th to the 14th of April (between Dentetsu Toyama and Midagahara)\u2019 .. is it possible for me to go there around 12 or 13 april? and what can we do there at that moment? thank you\nHi Indriasari!\nThe Alpine Route is closed from December 1st to April 14th. So the first day you can do the Alpine Route is on the 15. April.\nUnfortunately, it looks like there was no partial route open this year from 10. \u2013 14. April 2023. Unless the partial route opens up again next year (2024), it looks like the first day you can go is on the 15. April. So it looks like you can not go there on the 12. or 13. April. Sorry about that.\nYou should check the official webpage of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route to see the opening date for 2024.\nThe big thing on the Alpine Route in the spring (April \u2013 June), is the huge 18 m tall snow wall. The Alpine Route is literally carved through the snow in April, so the sight is quite impressive. You can read more about it here: https://www.alpen-route.com/en/seasonal-attraction/spring.html\nAll the best,\nMaria\nHas alpine route got strictly fixed dates of opening?\nOur Family of 4 will be having nights of 7,8,9 April to spend between Kyoto to Tokyo.Just wondering if we should simply do Kanazawa day , Shirakawago night followed by Takayama day , Matsumoto night and then Shibuonsen night?\nVery confused\nHi Jyoti!\nYes, the Alpine Route has fixed opening days, the same dates every year. It is open from the 15th of April to the 30th of November. So it is not open on your dates (7. \u2013 9. April).\nWith only three nights (7. \u2013 9. April) to spend between Kyoto and Tokyo, it is way too ambitious to do Kanazawa, Shirakawago, Takayama, Matsumoto, and Shibu Onsen. You will not have time to see anything at each place. It is simply not doable, either, as it will take time to get between these places too. Do you plan on renting a car? This will, however, save you some traveling time.\nI suggests that you do either Kanazawa and/ or Takayama (with a day trip to Shirakawago). So for instance two nights in Kanazawa, then do Shirakawago on your way to Takayama. And one night in Takayama:\n\u2013 6. April: Take the train Kyoto \u2013 Kanazawa (a 2-hour train ride)\n\u2013 6. \u2013 8. April (2 nights): Kanazawa\n\u2013 8. April: Take the bus Kanazawa \u2013 Takayama, with a stop in Shirakawago (a 2-hour bus ride Kanazawa \u2013 Takayama)\n\u2013 8. \u2013 9. April (1 night): Takayama\n\u2013 9. April: Take the train Takayama \u2013 Tokyo (a 4-hour train ride)\nHave a fantastic trip to Japan in April!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nThanks a lot Maria.\nI was feeling suffocated with speed of my own plans \ud83d\ude42 thanks helping me slow down.\nI read on websites that Kyoto and Kanazawa a pretty similar and Takayama gives more different feel . To add diversity to my trip ( but not on cost of missing places wort going in time I have ), do you think it will be good idea to skip kanazawa and rather do\nKyoto to\nTakayama ( 1 night)\n+Shirakawago\nAND\nMatsumato ( 1 night)\n+ Jigukundani (shibu onsen) ( 1 night)\nthen to Tokyo\nI am really looking for suggestions and thanks again for your reply\nJyoti \ud83d\ude42\nYes, you can skip Kanazawa, and do Matsumoto and Jigukundani instead.\n1 night in Matsumoto is enough (the biggest attraction there is Matsumoto Castle). But 1 night in Takayama might be stressful, especially if you want to do a day-trip to Shirakawago. The bus trip between Takayama and Shirakawago takes about 1 hour one way. But you might be able to do Shirakawago as a morning trip (leave your bags at Takayama Station and pick it up again before heading on to Matsumoto).\nThe train trip Kyoto \u2013 Takayama is a bit longer than to Kanazawa. It is a 3,5 hour train trip, since the fast Shinkansen train does not go all the way to Takayama. You must take the Shinkansen to Nagoya Station, then change there to a rapid train up to Takayama.\nTo get from Takamaya to Matsumoto, it is quickest to take the bus (2 h 40 min). The train trip takes 5-6 hours (via Toyama Station).\nSo your itinerary will be something like this:\n\u2013 6. april: In the morning, take the train Kyoto \u2013 Takayama (3,5 hours)\n\u2013 6. \u2013 7. april (1 night): Explore Takayama\n\u2013 7. april: Morning return bus ride Takayama \u2013 Shirakawago (2 hours return bus ride). In the afternoon/ evening, take the bus Takayama \u2013 Matsumoto (2,5 h bus ride). Stay 1 night in Matsumoto\n\u2013 8. april: Explore Matsumoto. In the afternoon, take the train/ bus to Shibu Onsen (2,5 h train ride Matsumoto Station \u2013 Yudanaka Station, then a 7-min taxiride to Shibu Onsen).\nI have added this itinerary to a Google Maps which you can see here.\nHave a great time in Japan!\n-Maria-\nHi Maria\nThis is a very useful guide, that has encouraged me to add the alpine route to my schedule. So much detail to help anyone plan, especially as it is a bit of the beaten track. I am basically following your steps at the end of June and looking forward to the views\nThanks very much\nHi John,\nThank you so much! So glad to hear that you are doing the Alpine Route! It is amazing and a great way to see the Japanese nature and not only big cities and temples.\nHave a fantastic trip to Japan in June!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nHi Maria, my husband and I are visiting Japan next month and have been using your blog a lot to inform our itinerary \u2013 thanks for all the in depth information! With the final leg of the journey from Tateyama to Toyama, do you remember if this was included in the ticket purchased for the Alpine route?? Thanks, Kate\nHi Kate,\nThank you so much!\nYes, I think our ticket included the leg Tateyama \u2013 Toyama. There are different tickets for sale, however, one that include the leg Tateyama \u2013 Toyama.\nYou can see the different tickets and the fares here: https://www.alpen-route.com/en/transport/fare.html\nThe total price from Shinano Omachi (where we started the Alpine Route, coming from Matsumoto) to Toyama is 14010 JPY (adult). This is approximately US$ 97.\nIf you want to buy ticket from Shinano Omachi to Tateyama only (not including Toyama), the price is 12590 JPY = US$ 87.\nThere are also combined tickets for sale (see the options at the bottom of the Alpine Route Webpage).\nYou can buy tickets for the Alpine Route here: https://tateyama-kurobe-webservice.jp/AlpenTour/html/registration/VW101W0010.html\nHave a fantastic trip to Japan and enjoy the Alpine Route!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nMaria, I am totally agree with you that this Alphine route is fascinating trip. We could experience seeing multiple beautiful sceneries (mountain, snow wall 10m, huge dam) with several mode of transportation (train, cable car, ropeway, trolley, bus) in just a day !!\nWe just back from this one day trip about a week ago. We took this Alphine route from Toyama to Ogizawa \u2013 Nagano. Fortunately, we still can arrange this trip despite only 6 days holiday in Osaka, Japan including traveling time from Indonesia. We took overnight bus from Osaka to Toyama so we could arrive early morning..\nI wish we could spend more days in Japan. Thanks for sharing detail info about this trip so I can get some info to put this story in my FB.\nHi Vivi,\nThank you so much! Sounds like you had a fantastic Alpine Route trip! Lucky you who got to see the snow wall, must have been incredible! We did the Alpine Route in autumn, so the snow wall was all melted by then.\nWe are actually in your home country Indonesia right now, currently on beautiful Gili Air. Love Indonesia!\nThanks again for commenting! Happy travels!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nHi Maria,\nMy son and I are heading to Japan in 4 weeks and your 2-week itinerary has been so useful in creating our plans. Thank-you !\nWe are really looking forward to travelling the Alpine Route but as our schedule is tight I was going to book tickets for the route in advance. My question is how much time should I allow between travelling from Matsumoto, and arriving at Ogizawa, where we start the trip ?\nHaving checked timetables there is a train that leaves Matsumoto at 07:48 and arrives at Shinano-Omachi at 08:52. We will certainly take advantage of the baggage drop off service there, and collect at Toyama. I can then choose a departure time from Ogizawa for the tickets, from 09:30, 10:00 or 10:30, which would you recommend ?\nThanks,\nMatt & Oz\nPS: We have also booked Onyado Nono Matsumoto Natural Hot Spring, as per your recommendation, and will be staying 2 nights in Kanazawa. We can\u2019t wait.\nHi Matt,\nAwesome that you are heading to Japan for two weeks with your son! So happy to hear that our Japan articles helped you plan your trip!\nThe bus from Shinano-Omachi Train Station to Ogizawa (start of the Alpine Route) takes 40 minutes. This bus is not possible to prebook, you must buy bus ticket at Shinano-Omachi Station when arriving there. You can find the time table for the bus here:\nhttps://visit-nagano.alpico.co.jp/timetable/omachi-ogizawa\nArriving at Shinano-Omachi at 08:52 (from Matsumoto), you will be able to catch the 10:00 bus from Shinano-Omachi to Ogizawa. Sadly, there is no bus departing at 09:30. So if you take the 10:00 bus, you will reach Ogizawa at 10:40.\nSo you should then buy the Alpine Route Ticket departing from Ogizawa at 11:00.\nAlternative, if you take the earliest train from Matsumoto to Shinano-Omachi, departing from Matsumoto at 07:15, you will be able to take a 1-hour earlier Alpine Route Ticket from Ogizawa (the 10:00 ticket instead of the 11:00 ticket). Then your Alpine Route itinerary will be:\n\u2013 Matsumoto \u2013 Shinano-Omachi (train): 07:15 \u2013 08:13\n\u2013 Shinano-Omachi \u2013 Ogizawa (bus): 08:30 \u2013 09:10 or 09:00 \u2013 09:40 (depending on how much queue there is at the baggage drop off)\n\u2013 Alpine Route ticket departure from Ogizawa: 09:30 or 10:00\nThe baggage drop-off at Shinano-Omachi did not take long for us, as they are very efficient at the drop-off office (you just have to fill out a note and pay). But the official webpage for the baggage service says: \u201cNo reservation is required. Please plan to arrive 20-30 minutes prior to departure.\u201d So just to make sure, you should probably buy the 10:00 Alpine Route tickets from Ogizawa (if you are able to take the 07:15 train from Matsumoto).\nAwesome that you have booked the Onyado Nono Matsumoto hotel. I think you will enjoy this hotel. We particularly loved the onsen (hot spring bath, both outside and inside bath) on the 10th floor with the best city view and free ice cream. We also appreciated the free Soba noodles and drinks in the evening. The only cons was that we found the pillows to be a bit hard, but you can ask at the reception to get western-style pillows if you want. And fantastic that you will stay two nights in Kanazawa! Our favorite city in Japan. \ud83d\ude42\nHave a fantastic trip to Japan in four weeks! Don\u2019t hesitate to send me more questions if you have any.\nAll the best,\nMaria\nHi Maria,\nThat is really helpful \u2013 and above and beyond what I was expecting in term of advice. We will go for the 07:15 train from Matsumoto.\nWe are following around 80% of your 2-week itinerary. We only have 13 nights so we are staying an extra night in Tokyo and doing a day trip from there to Hakone. We are then going straight from Kyoto to Nagoya to see the sumo on our last night. Not sure if you have visited Nagoya ? I know we are missing Hiroshima and Nara but a sumo tournament felt too good to miss !\nIf I may ask 2 more, hopefully quick, questions\u2026\nWe were thinking of spending 2 nights in Kanazawa, and then take the bus to Shirakawa-go, spend 2-3 hours there, and then take the bus on to Takayama, where we have booked 2 nights. It would mean we have our bags \u2013 but felt a better use of time than doing a round trip to Shirakawa-go from either city. Would you agree ?\nSecondly, we know we wont be able to cover everything in Tokyo in just 4 days, but I wondered if there were any walking tours you would recommend ? Whilst I am happy to walk the city it would be great to listen to a guide tell us a little more about the history.\nThanks again.\nMatt & Oz\nHi Matt & Oz,\nSo sorry for my way too late reply. We have been traveling around Indonesia for a month with bad internet connection, and just got back home in Norway.\nI agree, doing Shirakawa-go as a stop along the way from Kanazawa to Takayama is the most time-consuming way to visit Shirakawa-go. There are coin locker at Shirakawago Bus Terminal (opening hours: 08:00 \u2013 17:00), so you can store your bags here while you explore Shirakawa-go. Small and medium size: 500 yen per box. Large size: 1,000 yen per box. Alternatively, you can use luggage forwarding service from Kanazawa to Takayama (the hotel you are staying at in Kanazawa can arrange this).\nWe have just updated and rewritten our Tokyo Itinerary, where we have included some excellent walking tours. You can find it here:\nhttps://nerdnomads.com/what-to-do-in-tokyo\nYou might already be in Japan? Anyway, have an amazing time in Japan!\nAll the best,\nMaria\nHi Maria,\nHope you had a great time travelling in Indonesia \u2013 I look forward to reading the blog !\nWe are in Japan now and have planned to take the bus route between Kanazawa and Takayama via Shirakawa-go. The lockers will be great for storing our bags while we explore.\nYou truly inspired our trip. We arrived yesterday and toured Meiji Shrine before travelling down Takeshita street and along Cat street with plenty of stops (a great matcha tea cafe there) on the way, before heading to the Shibuya crossing. We are staying in Shinjuku and pushed through jet lag to see it lit up at night \u2013 thanks for mentioning the Godzilla head which is awesome, we also saw the 3D cat on the building to the South of Shinjuku station.\nToday is Senso-ji Temple, Yanaka and Akihabara with either the Tokyo Skytree or the river cruise depending on the weather.\nThanks again \u2013 all our best wishes from Japan !\nMatt and Oz\nHow to travel the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route in Japan\nThe Alpine Route is a 90 km route that connects Shinano-Omachi (east Japan) with Toyama (west Japan).\nThe route is divided into nine sections with different type of transport as well as walking.\nThe Japan Alps in the middle of Japan\nTake the train to the start of the route, either Shinano-Omachi on the east side or Toyama on the west side\n15. April \u2013 30. November (full route)\nThe Alpine Route is unfortunately not covered by the JR Pass.\nBut you can use the JR Pass to get to the start of the Alpine Route.\nThe full route takes at least 6-7 hours. We used 9 hours.\nWhat to wear: It is cold and windy at the top, so wear warm clothes like trousers, shoes, and a jacket\nOfficial Webpage of the Alpine Route:\u00a0http://www.alpen-route.com/en/\nDesign by Nerd Nomads Visuals using the GeneratePress Theme\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2025 - NERD NOMADS",

With this easter egg, warp back in time with a class Macintosh theme to relive the magic on your iPhone. Change the date on your iPhone to January 1, 1970, press and hold the power button to reboot your device, and prepare for a wild ride!\nAs cool as this might look, it\u2019s a hoax, and a particularly nasty one at that. Resetting your phone\u2019s date that far back will so thoroughly confuse your phone or tablet\u2019s operating system that you\u2019ll either need to take it to the Apple store for a replacement, or just buy a whole new phone or tablet:\nIf you're worried about doing this by accident, don't.\u00a0Setting the date on your phone is an onerous and time-consuming process, so there\u2019s not much of a chance that you could accidentally brick your phone. However, it\u2019s possible \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 that someone with time and malicious intent could trick a phone connected to a network into resetting its date by pretending to be a time server.\nThe date bug affects iPhones, iPads and iPod touches with 64-bit processors running iOS 8 or iOS 9. Apple says it\u2019s looking into the bug. According to the Guardian, users can protect themselves with a series of tweaks, such as manually setting their time and date, not enabling automatic time changes, and not turning off their iPhone or iPads.\nIf you must have an old-school theme for your tablet or phone, fear not: they do exist! (Of course, all caveats about downloading third-party apps and jailbreaking your device do apply.) It's worth noting, by the way, that the very first Apple computer, the Apple I, came out not in 1970, but in 1976.\nOn 15 February 2016, Apple confirmed that the bug exists, and said that an upcoming software update will address the issue.\nBrooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Whatever You Do, Don't Set Your iPhone To 1970 [Updated]\nThe tech world loves their Easter eggs, from Adventure\u2019s original hidden feature to Tesla\u2019s various car tricks. But don\u2019t fall for the recent claims for one hidden in your iPhone: if you attempt it, you\u2019ll brick your device.\nA prank originating from 4chan claims that if you set your iPhone\u2019s (5s models and up) date back to 1970, it\u2019ll display a retro Apple logo:\nWhat actually happens if you decide to set your iPhone back to January 1st, 1970? It\u2019ll brick your device, and there\u2019s no fix for it: even Apple\u2019s own Geniuses can\u2019t figure out how to fix it, and you\u2019ll have to get the phone completely replaced.\nUpdate: according to Ars Technica, this happens because January 1st, 1970 is the first day of the Unix epoch, and that allowing the phone\u2019s battery to go completely dead (or disconnecting the battery) will reset the date.\nYouTube user Zach Straley provides a good demonstration of what actually happens when you sent your phone back in time:\nFortunately, this isn\u2019t a thing you can do accidentally: there\u2019s quite a bit of effort on your part to actually set the date back almost five decades, but it\u2019s one of those things where curiosity just shouldn\u2019t take over.\n[Wired]\nImage credit: Attila Fodemesi / Shuttershock\nFollow the author on Twitter @AndrewLiptak\nGet the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\nNews from the future, delivered to your present.\nPlease select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\nThe great AirPods slowdown is upon us.\nA chief economist at investment giant Apollo says the top ten AI stocks are more detached from reality than the tech titans of the 1990s were.

But what the date change actually triggers is a newly discovered bug that promptly 'bricks' your phone, effectively turning it into a fancy-looking, inert paperweight.\nThe bug presents itself if you set the internal date back to 1 January 1970 in the iPhone's Date & Time settings. And it's not a cute trick that you should try for yourself \u2013 winding the clock back that far and rebooting the device is said to render the device completely unusable. Don't give in to curiosity on this one, folks! Just leave it alone.\nWhile it appears this unfortunate glitch may have been discoverable for some time, awareness of the bug and the problems it causes has only recently blown up on the Internet after a deliberately misleading image started circulating on web sites and social media.\nThe image, seen below, which reportedly first appeared on 4chan, emulates the appearance of Apple's promotional material and urges people to change the date on their devices and then reboot, promising a \"wild ride\" for those who are game.\nThe implication is they'll discover a hidden Easter Egg in the form of a retro '70s-style Apple logo from the company's past. Unfortunately, this doesn't actually happen. What does happen is your expensive iPhone becomes an expensive non-phone.\nThe shared image that's causing iPhone pain. Do not try this at home. Credit: Apple/Anonymous\nAccording to reports, the rebooted device will be inoperable and cannot be restored via iTunes backups, and even 'Genius' staff at Apple Stores are unable to fix the problem, meaning you could have to get an entirely new phone.\nIt's also not limited just to iPhones, and can affect iPads and iPod touches running iOS 8 or iOS 9. However, only newer iOS devices running on 64-bit processors appear to be affected by the glitch, including the iPhone 5s or newer, iPad Air or newer, iPad mini 2 or newer, or sixth-generation iPod touch. (Even if you've got an older device, however, we wouldn't recommend playing with fire!)\nSo why does this crazy bug brick your iPhone in the first place? At time of writing Apple hasn't confirmed anything, but it's being speculated that winding the clock back to 1 January 1970 \u2013 which just happens to be a fundamental date in the way that Unix-based computer systems process time \u2013 is creating what could be an 'integer underflow'.\nCalled the Unix epoch, that date is effectively Day Zero as far as Unix computers are concerned, the point from which all subsequent time is counted and calculated.\nAnd by setting the date at this time, at least according to speculation online (and seen in the video below), it's possible the software in the phone is trying to calculate other retrospective things \u2013 such as battery life estimates, perhaps \u2013 in relation to times or dates that happened before Day Zero.\nThis, as far as the phone might be concerned, is impossible. In any case, the resulting attempts at reconciling the date end up bricking the iPhone entirely.\nIn the absence of an explanation from Apple \u2013 which will likely issue a software patch at some point to address the issue \u2013 nobody knows for sure if this hypothesis is exactly what's causing this problem. But for most of us, as Brian Barrett at Wired puts it, fully understanding the root of the glitch isn't really as valuable as simply knowing what not to do here.\n\"The why and who are less important,\" he writes, \"than the what, and the what is: don't set your phone's calendar back. Live in the present. It'll save you a lot of future headaches.\"",

The Facebook page \"Donald Trump Is Our President\" (@the45thpresident) went further and implied that those dead voters were Democrats:\nThese social media posts did not link to a recent article concerning the recount taking place in Florida in November 2018, but rather to a 6-year-old story about the impact of a new (and controversial) voter-related law which was originally published by Fox News back in 2012:\nThe questions about voter eligibility surface as the state continues its months-long efforts to scrub the rolls, including asking supervisors to remove more than 53,000 dead people discovered by comparing voter rolls to federal Social Security files. This was the first time the state checked the files. It was allowed under a controversial election law that passed the GOP-controlled Legislature last year.\nThis story did not claim that any of the dead people found on Florida voter rolls in 2012 had actually voted in the election. Furthermore, election officials questioned the methodology that was used in order to generate the list of people to be purged from the voter rolls:\nOn that front, it's begun a new effort. Florida's top elections officials recently sent to the counties a list of 53,000 people believed to be dead who should be removed from the voter rolls.\nThat's something county elections officials do routinely, using death notices. Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, says she held off sending letters to people identified as potential noncitizens because she had questions about the state's methodology. With that experience in mind, she's leery about the new list as well.\n\"In the situation with the deceased persons, we have no evidence -- they just told us about it,\" she says. \"So I'd like to see some documentation so that I can do some research to make sure that that's not faulty also.\"\nThis was the second time that an outdated and out-of-context article about Florida's voter rolls in 2012 went viral on social media during the November 2018 recount. Donald Trump Jr. helped spread another false rumor when he shared an article from 2012 to back up his claim that \"Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens\":\nTrump Jr. did not mention that the article he was sharing was several years old when he posted it on Twitter, nor did he include the Editor's Note at the top of the article noting the actual figure of non-citizen registrants ultimately discovered and removed from Florida voting rolls was a mere 85:\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.\nLopez, German. \u00a0 \"The Florida Voter Fraud Allegations, Explained.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Vox. \u00a0 12 November 2018.\nFineout, Gary. \u00a0 \"2012 Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 WTVJ. \u00a0 11 May 2012.\nAllen, Greg. \u00a0 \"World War II Vet Caught Up in Florida's Voter Purge Controversy.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 NPR. \u00a0 31 May 2012.\nFox News. \u00a0 \"53K Dead People on Florida's Voter Rolls.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 17 May 2012.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Debunking Viral Claims Archives - FactCheck.org\nThese articles debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Some social media posts cited a Craigslist ad to falsely claim it showed that people protesting the immigration raids in Los Angeles were being paid for their actions. But a pair of podcasters told the Associated Press they placed the ad as a prank for their show, and it had nothing to do with the protests.\nQ: Did President Donald Trump call military nurse Ruby Bradley a \u201closer,\u201d and were there orders for her service history to be removed from Department of Defense archives?\nA: There\u2019s no evidence for these claims. We could find no record of Trump referring to nurse Ruby Bradley, who received 34 medals for her service during World War II and the Korean War. A Pentagon spokesperson told us that there was \u201cnothing deleted and/or taken offline related to Ruby Bradley\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said in a March 30 interview that \u201cthere are methods\u201d for him to serve a third term in the White House, and a Daily Mail article referred to a \u201cloophole\u201d in the 22nd Amendment that would make it possible.

But social media posts falsely claim that as part of that effort, DOGE stopped \u201croyalties\u201d to former President Barack Obama related to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The claim came from a satirical website.\nA fake audio clip of Donald Trump Jr. saying that the U.S. should have sent weapons to Russia instead of Ukraine was shared across social media.

Those staffing cuts did not cause the high number of deaths in the flash floods on July 4, experts said. Local forecasting offices were sufficiently staffed and issued timely warnings. But experts raised concerns about key positions being vacant, which could have affected coordination with local communities.\n\n### Evaluating the effect of viral posts on social media engagement\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Nonetheless, there has been little consideration of whether these viral events genuinely boost the attention received by the source. To address this gap, we analyze content timelines from over 1000 European news outlets from 2018 to 2023 on Facebook and YouTube, employing a Bayesian structural time series model to evaluate the impact of viral posts. Our results show that most viral events do not significantly increase engagement and rarely lead to sustained growth. We identify two primary types of viral effects corresponding to different mechanisms of collective attention response. A \u2018loaded-type\u2019 virality manifests after a sustained growth phase, representing its final burst, followed by a decline in attention. A \u2018sudden-type\u2019 virality, with news emerging unexpectedly, reactivates the collective response process. Moreover, quick viral effects fade faster, while slower processes lead to more persistent growth. These findings highlight the transient nature of viral events and underscore the importance of consistent, steady attention-building strategies to establish a solid connection with the user base rather than relying on sudden visibility spikes.\nThe advent and proliferation of social media have fundamentally altered the information landscape1,2. As these platforms have become integrated into our daily lives, transforming into essential tools for information diffusion3,4 and personal communication5, they have merged entertainment-driven business models with complex social dynamics6, raising significant concerns about their potential impact on social dynamics7,8,9,10,11. Offering unprecedented opportunities for content to achieve rapid and widespread attention12,13, social media have become crucial environments for the spread of information and misinformation worldwide14,15, especially during sensitive periods such as global elections16,17.\nThis complex interplay has resulted in an ecosystem in which information overload is the foremost feature18, considerably complicating the search for information while giving rise to the phenomenon of infodemics19,20, such as for the COVID-19 pandemic. To this effect, evidence in the literature highlights how online users are prone to consume information aligning with their existing beliefs21,22,23,24,25 and commonly ignore opposing viewpoints26,27. In this competitive environment, which stands out for such an unprecedented amount of available content, a wide range of content creators\u2014from news organizations to individual influencers28,29\u2014compete for the limited resource that is users\u2019 attention30,31,32,33.\nUnderstanding the attention economy in the digital domain is paramount for navigating this vying information market, whereby the pursuit of virality34, characterized by content\u2019s exceptional reach and engagement, plays a pivotal role in shaping how information sources design their strategies of production and diffusion of content. Though one of the most complex issues is understanding why certain items achieve sudden and widespread dissemination while other similar or higher-quality items remain overlooked35,36,37, there is substantial agreement in the literature about sentiment polarity and emotional resonance being a critical trigger of virality38,39, particularly with negative emotions and extreme or sensitive content40,41,42.\nAs a core feature of this environment, virality naturally presents both opportunities and concerns. The potential to rapidly reach a wider audience is undoubtedly appealing to sources, influencing how the information supply side operates, notably in exploiting the algorithmic peculiarities of each platform. On the other hand, its unpredictability43 and the hurdle of monitoring such a volume of sources and content raise serious concerns about its consequences for society, particularly when referring to viral news and their potential impact on the public discourse.\nAgainst this background, there has been little consideration of whether viral events genuinely boost attention in the short and long term. In today\u2019s online ecosystem, it becomes crucial to understand how collective attention responds to abrupt news diffusion and how sudden spikes of visibility reverberate on the subsequent attention captured by the source. As users\u2019 behavior could exhibit persistent patterns across different platforms, topics, and contexts44, the comparative analysis of diverse social media can isolate unaltered consistencies of human dynamics in the digital ecosystem.\nIn this perspective, this study aims to enhance our comprehension of collective attention through a data-driven approach by exploring the dynamics of virality and its effects on users\u2019 engagement on different social media platforms. By analyzing data from Facebook and YouTube, we examine attention patterns after viral posts to assess how these events influence users\u2019 interactions over time. In this study, we use a comparative interrupted time-series (CITS) design implemented using a Bayesian structural time series model (BSTS)45 to evaluate the impact of viral posts on users\u2019 engagement. In our approach, we apply the BSTS by using increasingly broader time windows to observe the effect of the same viral event from a short-term to a long-term perspective. Based on the BSTS\u2019s results, we conduct our analysis first by examining the magnitude of the impact and then its temporal dynamics to address the following two research questions.\nRQ1: Does virality induce engagement growth?\nOur first research question aims to assess whether and how a viral event leads to increased users\u2019 attention received by the source. After that, our second research question aims to analyze the temporal dynamics of these effects to evaluate if the rapidity at which they occur influences their longevity.\nRQ2: Do the faster-emerging effects persist longer?\nWhile our first research question basically aims to determine the actual impact of virality and its magnitude, the second analysis focuses on the relationship between the speed of manifestation and the longevity of the effects. This approach will help determine whether effects that emerge more quickly tend to persist longer or, conversely, if they vanish more rapidly than slow-emerging ones. This analysis provides concrete insights into how collective attention responds to sudden stress conditions, like viral news, and to determine whether these events genuinely contribute to sustained growth or merely act as transient spotlights.\nWe begin by selecting a list of news outlets from NewsGuard46, an organization known for monitoring news outlet activities internationally, rating more than 35,000 news and information sources across several countries. We select all the reported news outlets from Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. NewsGuard provides several categories of descriptive metadata, including the URLs of these news sources\u2019 social media accounts, if available. For Facebook, after identifying all the news outlets with active accounts listed on NewsGuard, we use their Facebook URLs to gather data via CrowdTangle. This Facebook-owned tool monitors interactions on public content from Facebook pages, groups, and verified profiles47. Using the \u2018Historical Data\u2019 feature in CrowdTangle, we download the complete content history of each page, starting from January 1, 2018. Similarly, for YouTube, after selecting all available accounts, we use the YouTube Data API48 to collect their list of published content. Given the fewer YouTube channels and videos compared to Facebook, we extend the observation period for YouTube to begin on January 1, 2016.\nTable\u00a01 provides an overview of the dataset, detailing the total number of Facebook Pages and YouTube channels used in our analysis for each country, along with their respective number of posts and videos. The longitudinal structure and temporal continuity of these page observations are crucial for evaluating the impact of viral events. Therefore, the resulting dataset is formatted consistently for both platforms, containing chronological information about each posted and accessible item. This naturally excludes any content that may have been removed by users or through platform moderation at the time of download. Note that in what follows, we will refer to both Facebook pages and YouTube channels as (information) sources and to Facebook posts and YouTube videos as either content or posts, specifying the platform in the latter case.\nOn social media platforms, virality represents the propensity of content to achieve rapid diffusion and high interactions levels from users34,43. To quantify virality, we use a bivariate approach based on two measures, spreading and interactions. For reasons of occurrence and availability of variables on the different platforms, we first identify the most appropriate metrics to evaluate the above mentioned measures to adapt them to the availability of variables and platform peculiarities, which generally represent the most challenging aspect of working with different social media.\nFor Facebook data, we adopt the metric provided by49, assessing that the suggested measurement works properly with our data. Originally defined on Twitter data, the proposed metric can be applied to any social media platform with equivalent Retweets and Followers metrics. On Facebook, Shares are equivalent to Retweets, representing the number of users sharing certain content. On both platforms, Followers represent the number of users subscribed to a given page at the time of posting. Therefore, on Facebook, we can define the Spreading S of a given post j of a Page i as:\nwhere \\(Followers_{it}\\) indicates the number of Followers of the Page i at time t, i.e. the time of posting.\nFor YouTube data, we do not have access to the number of Subscribers at the date of posting as well as the number of Shares. Nonetheless, we can define it using the video Views metric, which specifically measures content spreading, being even more suitable for estimating content diffusion on a video-based platform such as YouTube. Therefore, on YouTube, we define the Spreading S of a given video j published by a Channel i at time t as:\nOn Facebook, interactions are measured by the Total Interactions, encompassing the total number of users\u2019 interactions with the post (the sum of Likes, Comments, and Shares). Therefore, on Facebook, we define the Total Interactions TI of a given post j of a Page i as:\nwhere t is the date in which post j appears. Since YouTube does not provide a share count (and consequently its Shares metric), we define the Total Interactions TI of a given video j of a Channel i published at day t as:\nSince we measure virality on social media as an (exceptional) over-performance of content regarding spreading and users\u2019 interactions, to detect it, we first apply a z-score standardization to both \\(S_{ijt}\\) and \\(TI_{ijt}\\) for each piece of content j from a source i. The mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) employed in the standardization formula are calculated by country and year so that the virality measurement takes into account potential variations of the temporal activity level of the respective country.\nOn Facebook, a post is considered viral if both its z-scores exceed 3. We set the threshold for YouTube at 2.5 to ensure a comparable number of videos and channels as in Facebook. The distributions of the two z-scores for both platforms are shown in Fig.\u00a01a\u2013h). Dotted lines in panels (a, c, e, g) represent the virality threshold for the displayed metric. The plots (b, d, f, h) zoom-in the distribution\u2019s upper tail of the chart to their left, representing the subset of values that exceed the threshold for the displayed metric (reported on the x-axis), distinguishing between viral content (which surpasses both thresholds) and non-viral content (which exceeds the threshold only in the displayed one). These insets reveal that the subset resulting from the combination of overperformances constitutes a small fraction of the distribution tails, especially on Facebook. Essentially, content may induce high interactions levels without widespread diffusion, or conversely, it may fail to engage users despite extensive reach. We also note that both the Spreading z-scores (panels a, e) display very similar distributions, further indicating that, although with different formulations, both metrics work appropriately as spreading estimators for the relative platform.\nFigure\u00a01i presents the distributions of viral posts per source, resulting from the virality detection measures, for Facebook and YouTube. As the Figure shows, despite the differences in sample sizes, both platforms exhibit similar heavy-tailed distributions over different scales reflecting the peculiar dynamics of content virality. If, on the one hand, a limited number of sources succeeded in achieving virality multiple times, it represented a unique or rare event for most of them. These observations further emphasize the exceptional rarity of virality, which reflects the most extreme manifestations of such skewed-distributed phenomena, highlighting the challenges in characterizing it.\nDistributions of z-scores and viral posts per platform. (a\u2013h) Distributions of Spreading and Interactions z-scores for Facebook (a\u2013d) and YouTube (e\u2013h). Each z-score is calculated with respect to the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the respective year and country. Dotted lines represent the virality threshold for the displayed metric. The plots (b,d,f,h) zoom-in the distribution\u2019s upper tail of the chart to their left, displaying the subset of values exceeding the threshold for the given metric (reported on the x-axis), showing its breakdown between viral contents (which exceed the threshold in both metrics) and non-viral ones (hence exceeding the threshold only in the displayed metric). (i) Distributions of viral posts per source, resulting from the virality detection measures, on Facebook and YouTube. Facebook sample sizes: Pages = 663, Posts = 9790; YouTube sample sizes: Channels = 236, Videos = 5879.\nAfter defining the procedure for detecting viral posts, we delve into our approach for evaluating the impact of viral events on the performance of Facebook pages and YouTube channels. In terms of attention received, we quantify the performance of a given source by calculating its daily engagement. We define the Engagement \\(E_{it}\\) of a source i at day t as the sum of the Total Interactions TI [as in Eqs.\u00a0(3), and\u00a0(4)] of all its j posts published that day, i.e.:\nIn assessing the total attention a news outlet receives, we interpret higher engagement as indicative of greater user attention, regardless of the number of posts published. This approach is based on the premise that increasing the content volume only results in heightened engagement if the content effectively captures users\u2019 attention. Conversely, high engagement across several posts implies high users\u2019 attention, and calculating its average value would potentially underestimate this effect43.\nOur analysis aims to evaluate the after-effects of a viral event on the source\u2019s performance in terms of attention caught. To inspect the attention dynamics following the event, we first assess whether the engagement received significantly changes after it. To detect a significant variation (either positive or negative) on the Engagement \\(E_{it}\\) after a viral event, we use a comparative interrupted time-series (CITS) design implemented using a Bayesian structural time series model (BSTS, hereafter)45, which has also been used in previous research50. In our approach, we apply BSTS to each viral event, using time windows associated with n weeks ahead and before, with n \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 6]\\), constructed as follows: for any given n, we exclude the day of the viral post and compare the engagement trend during the n weeks following the event to the expected trend based on the n weeks preceding it\u2014hence, having a windows of \\(2n \\times 7\\) days\u2014and controlling for the presence of other viral posts. Based on the BSTS\u2019s results, we then conduct our analysis to address our two research questions, first examining the magnitude of the impact and then its temporal dynamics.\nWe first inspect the BSTS\u2019s results, which provide us with a useful initial overview to help delve into the analysis. We start from the premise that each viral post can have a positive, null, or negative effect on the subsequent engagement in the considered time window. To evaluate the effect, we use two variables provided by the BSTS:\nthe Average Absolute Effect, which indicates whether the impact was positive or negative, along with its magnitude\nthe statistical significance of the effect, which is captured by the p value \\(p_\\alpha\\) of BSTS at a confidence level \\(\\alpha\\). For the analysis, we set \\(\\alpha =0.05\\).\nEffects after virality with increasing time windows. The y-axis represents the percentage of Growth, No Effect, and Decrease cases, for each time scale on the x-axis. Links represent the effects flow between consecutive weeks, color-coded according to the first observed effect (i.e., in the 2-week window).\nIf the effect has no statistical significance at a confidence level \\(\\alpha\\), we consider that virality did not have a discernible impact on users\u2019 engagement\u2014which we refer to as No Effect. Otherwise, if the effect is statistically significant and the observed engagement significantly deviates from the expected trend based on the examined n weeks, we consider that virality had a Growth or Decrease effect on users\u2019 attention as quantified by the Average Absolute Effect. For our analyses, we use the BSTS implementation from the CausalImpact R package51. We begin by examining the proportion of cases that exhibit positive, null, or negative impacts and assess their consistency across various time windows. The results are reported in Fig.\u00a02, which shows the percentage of Growth, No Effect, and Decrease cases on the y-axis for each time scale on the x-axis. The diagram includes links representing the effects flow between consecutive weeks, color-coded according to the first observed effect to maintain a clear visual trajectory through the data stream. A significant observation from this analysis regards the high percentage of cases showing no statistically significant impact on engagement performance. This first finding suggests that virality does not necessarily enhance engagement, as it often results in an indiscernible impact. Secondly, the percentages of Growth and Decrease cases are comparable, with slightly higher occurrences of negative impacts. This suggests that, apart from being infrequent, the impact of a viral event on users\u2019 attention can even be detrimental. Contrary to common expectations34,52,53, virality rarely induces engagement growth. Furthermore, we observe that effects typically emerge or shift between the second and fourth weeks, with the most significant transitions happening from the third to the fourth week. Beyond this period, the consistency of effects is broadly stable. Given the inherently short-term nature of virality, effects observed in larger time scales, such as 5- and 6-week windows, are less likely to be directly attributable to the viral event. In our study, these longer time windows are primarily aimed at assessing the persistence of earlier effects. This allows us to analyze the dynamics from short-term to long-term perspectives in the following sections and distinguish the boundary between these periods.\nAs our first research question aims to assess whether\u2014and how\u2014a viral event impacts users\u2019 attention received by the source after its occurrence, we now deepen the dynamics of the virality effect on Engagement by focusing exclusively on the Growth and Decrease cases. In Fig.\u00a03, we present the joint density of the slopes of the attention trends preceding the viral posts and the absolute effects on engagement after the event. The \u2018Trend Pre Virality\u2019 on the y-axis represents the \\(\\beta _1\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. On the x-axis, we show the Average Absolute Effect on Engagement in the examined n-week window after virality, accounting for its previous trend. Figure\u00a03 reports the values for the 2-week window as an example, while SI Fig.\u00a01 shows the results for other timescales on both platforms which display consistent results. As Fig.\u00a03 shows, the density is split into two opposing quadrants: from growth to decrease and from decrease to growth, highlighting a significant negative correlation between the preceding trend and the consequent absolute effect. This dynamic shows consistency on both platforms and across their timescales, as shown in SI Table\u00a01, which reports the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between the \\(\\beta _1\\) coefficient of the trend preceding virality and the Average Absolute Effect on Engagement.\nDensity of the trend preceding the viral post and the average absolute effect on engagement for the 2-week time window. Trend Pre Virality is the \\(\\beta 1\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS on the weeks preceding virality. Given its previous trend, the average Absolute Effect is the average effect on the Engagement after the viral event. Only events with a statistically significant effect on Engagement are shown.\nTherefore, virality positively impacts users\u2019 engagement when occurring as a sudden event on a declining collective attention. Conversely, when virality manifests following a sustained growth phase, it represents the final burst of that growth process, with users\u2019 attention successively standing on lower levels than its previous phase. These results shed light on the bounded yet elastic nature of collective attention. While additional growth following a sustained growth phase is extremely rare, viral events act as a booster when users\u2019 attention is likely to nearing its lower bound, reactivating the collective response process. By focusing on viral news, these results potentially indicate the presence of two different types of viral events. The first is a \u2018loaded-type\u2019 virality, where attention progressively increases, culminating in the viral event. This type could occur in scenarios where information is gradually revealed, such as sequences of rumors, confirmations, and official announcements. The second type represents a \u2018sudden-type\u2019 virality, with the news emerging unexpectedly as an exogenous event. Based on the release patterns of information, this interpretation could explain the differences between the two types, along with the inverse relationship between the preceding attention pattern and the after-effect of the viral news.\nClassification of viral events based on: Viral Time of the viral post (on rows, indicated by the upper label) and Inter-Event Time (IET) from the previous viral post (on columns, indicated by the lower label). Points are color coded according to the Starting Engagement Level, which is the \\(\\beta _0\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. Points represent the model results using the 2-week time window, only events with a statistically significant effect on Engagement are shown.\nIn SI Figs.\u00a02 and\u00a03 we report the results of the BSTS model by using the daily average Engagement instead of its daily sum, assessing the consistency of our results, while SI Table\u00a02 reports the summary of events analyzed by the BSTS model by using the daily sum Engagement and daily average Engagement.\nTo further characterize such dynamics, we now aim to investigate whether the timing characteristics of the event influence its dynamics of growth and decrease, both in the previous trend and in its after-effect. To do so, we first perform a classification of the viral posts based on two features:\nThe \u2018Viral Time\u2019, indicating the N-th times that the viral post represents achieving virality for its source. For example, if the viral post is the first viral post for the source, its Viral Time will be 1; if it is the tenth, it will be 10, etc.\nThe Inter-Event Time (IET) between the viral post and the previous one of the same source.\nWe partition each feature into 3 classes, defined as follows:\nLess than 10, from 10 to 50, and more than 50 for the Viral Time.\nLess than 48\u00a0h, within 2 weeks, and more than 2 weeks for the IET.\nIn this way, we account for both the proximity of two viral posts and the propensity of the source to reach for virality, at the time of the viral event. Then, in Fig.\u00a04 we reproduce the relationship previously shown in Fig.\u00a03, this time by representing the point color coded according to the initial level of engagement, which is the \\(\\beta _0\\) coefficient of the regression estimated by the BSTS for the n weeks preceding the viral event. As in Fig.\u00a03, we use the results of the 2-week time window and represent only the events with a statistically significant effect.\nAs Fig.\u00a04 shows, such dynamics display consistency and invariance anew, also according to current timing characteristics. Firstly, we note how it is less likely for pages with less than ten viral posts to experience a viral post within 48\u00a0h from the previous one. Similarly, it is less likely to experience it more than 2 weeks apart for pages with more than 50 viral times. Apart from these two reasonably expected and inherent differences, the dynamics are reproduced consistently and with similar numbers in all the feature combinations. Moreover, a noteworthy insight is represented by the lower starting Engagement displayed by viral posts with increasing trends and negative after-effects, compared to their counterparts, which instead show higher starting levels. This upshot further agrees with the previously evidenced bounded and elastic behaviors of collective attention. When the viral event follows a sustained growth phase starting from a low-attention level, such growth is unlikely to persist after the event, which will represent its final burst of attention. Conversely, viral events are confirmed to act as a booster when users\u2019 attention is previously decreasing, even more so whether it starts from high initial levels, reactivating the collective response process. Ultimately, our results highlight how virality exhibits invariant dynamics of collective attention mechanisms, which reproduce consistently also regarding timing traits of the event.\nFor a further perspective, we also assess such consistency regarding content type characteristics. In this case, we only perform this analysis on Facebook since all YouTube content is exclusively videos. These results are reported in SI Fig.\u00a04, representing the distributions of content types for the whole dataset and the subsample of viral posts (panel a), the distributions of the Average Absolute Effects per content type (panel b), and its previously mentioned relationship with the Trend Pre Virality per content type (panel c). In this case, we find consistency and invariance of such attention patterns also regarding content characteristics rather than explanatory factors of growth or decline, ultimately indicating how virality is a phenomenon primarily tied to the attention mechanisms of users rather than content features.\nTo conclude our investigation of virality dynamics, we aim to examine the relationship between the speed at which effects manifest and their persistency over time. By using increasingly wider time windows, we can observe the effect of the same viral event from a short-term to a long-term perspective. For each detected effect, its emergence and its subsequent persistency can be determined through a classification based on the output from the BSTS model.\nFor each viral post j of a page i, we define the time of emergence \\(\\tau ^{(em)}_{ij}\\) of its effect:\nas the smallest time window during which a Growth or Decrease effect manifests, where \\(p_{ij}(n)\\) is the p value of BSTS applied to the associated n-week time window. Similarly, the fade-out time, \\(\\tau ^{(f-o)}_{ij}\\), is identified as the earliest time window in which the previously detected effect no longer manifests, i.e.,\nWe notice that the sets associated to the definitions of \\(\\tau ^{(em)}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\tau ^{(f-o)}_{ij}\\) are not empty in the cases treated in this paper. Notice also that the \\(\\tau\\)\u2019s lead to a partition of the collection of the posts with the related pages. Specifically, fixed \\({\\bar{n}}\\), we define\nWe define the persistency \\(\\phi _{kh}\\) as the fraction of posts still having persistent effects at a given week h after their emergence time k, i.e.,\nwhere \\(|\\bullet |\\) is the cardinality of set \\(\\bullet\\), for each k \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 5]\\) and h \\(\\displaystyle \\in [k+1, 6]\\).\nHence, we evaluate the effect\u2019s decay by calculating the fraction of still persistent effects after each week, grouped by their time of emergence. For instance, over the total number of cases where the impact appears 2 weeks after virality, we calculate the proportion of persistent effects in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week. This method allows us to derive the effect\u2019s decay curve for each time of emergence k \\(\\displaystyle \\in [2, 5]\\).\nAt this stage, we are able to observe the persistency rate up to a minimum of 2 weeks after the viral event. By fitting a negative exponential function of k and power law in h, we can estimate the variation of the exponent of the decay curves based on their time of emergence k as:\nThis procedure allows us to describe the decay behavior of the effects based on their emergence time and to extend it to their unobservable earlier phases as if we approach them asymptotically.\nThe results of the fitting procedure are reported in Table\u00a02, while Fig.\u00a05 shows the graphical representation of the decay curves for each emergence time. Solid lines represent the estimated decay for the observed curves\u2014from the 2nd week to the 5th week of emergence time\u2014along with their observed persistency. The dotted lines represent the corresponding extrapolated decay curves for 0 and 1 week after virality as emergence time. The curves representing extrapolations inherently involve higher uncertainty and should be considered useful asymptotic approximations for understanding the dynamics during their unobservable phases.\nPersistency of the virality effect based on its time of emergence. Solid lines represent the estimated decay for the observed curves\u2014from the 2nd week to the 5th week of emergence time\u2014along with their observed values. The dotted lines represent the corresponding extrapolated decay curves for 0 and 1 week after virality as emergence time.\nAccording to the estimations, in about 50% of cases, the impact either fades out within the first week following the viral event or does not occur. Moreover, the data consistently show that earlier emergences of viral impacts are associated with faster decay across both platforms. This indicates that faster processes tend to fade quicker, while slower ones exhibit more persistence. This finding highlights the elastic nature of collective attention when stretched to its limits. The volatile and fluctuating nature of attention prevents it from being steadily focused, resulting in a trade-off between the rapidity of the effect and its durability. These observations have critical implications for content producers in the digital realm, underscoring a clear distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics of collective attention. From a probabilistic perspective, sudden and disproportionate growth is rare and seldom leads to a noticeable positive impact on engagement. Even when it occurs, its effects tend to fade away swiftly. Conversely, organic and sustained growth, though slower to manifest, tends to have more enduring effects. This contrast emphasizes the transient nature of viral events compared to the lasting effectiveness of consistent engagement, highlighting the importance of gradual and continuous attention-building strategies rather than relying on abrupt surges of visibility.\nThis study examines how viral events affect users\u2019 engagement on social media platforms and the relationship between their emergence and subsequent persistency. Our findings highlight collective attention\u2019s bounded and elastic nature under sudden stress conditions, such as viral events, and have significant implications for the information sources ecosystem in the digital domain, challenging the common assumption that virality regularly enhances user engagement.\nOur analysis reveals that viral events rarely lead to engagement growth, suggesting that the frantic pursuit of sudden visibility is often unproductive. As the virality effect usually depends on the engagement trend preceding the viral post, typically reversing it, we identify two primary types of virality, each corresponding to a different mechanism of collective attention response. The first type, \u2018loaded-type virality,\u2019 is characterized by a gradual increase of engagement that culminates in a final burst of attention in the viral event. The second type, \u2018sudden-type virality,\u2019 occurs when news emerges unexpectedly, similar to an exogenous event, and is the only scenario in which virality enhances users\u2019 engagement, reactivating the collective response process. Regardless of whether the impact is positive or negative, our findings indicate that effects emerging more quickly tend to fade faster, while slower-emerging processes are more persistent over time. As well as being extremely rare, virality does not turn out to be an effective long-term growth strategy.\nThe rapid dissipation of viral impacts illustrates the volatility and fluctuation of collective attention. The resulting trade-off between the rapidity of an impact\u2019s emergence and its lasting presence further emphasizes the critical role of content producers and their challenges in capturing and maintaining users\u2019 engagement. These insights underscore the advantages of establishing a solid and enduring connection with the user base through organic and continued growth strategies rather than mainly aiming for transient\u2014and episodic\u2014viral spikes. In conclusion, although virality can temporarily surge users\u2019 attention, its effects are usually short-lived, making the frantic pursuit of sudden visibility an often fruitless strategy.\nConsequently, this evidence brings significant implications for stakeholders and policymakers in understanding collective online behavior, which could help shape the guidelines for monitoring the evolution of potentially sensitive or harmful content. As viral events exhibit such erratic and transient connotations, focusing solely on them and their forecasting could be costly and inefficient, while monitoring topics showing long-term trends should be less problematic and more effective.\nThis work also presents some limitations. Without having a temporal granularity that allows us, we can not evaluate the Interactions or Spreading evolution over time for each post, only relying on their final value. Nonetheless, our approach relies on the fact that posts on social media generally exhibit a lifetime of 24\u201348\u00a0h27,54,55,56,57. Moreover, since our analysis focuses on news items, which inherently have a limited time reference, a total value should represent an equivalent measurement for each post without representing a distortion towards older ones, considering that it is unlikely that users would interact with old news after long periods.\nThe findings of this study are specifically tied to the platforms analyzed, the type of pages examined, and the period considered. Although the results are consistent with general human dynamics observed in other collective attention studies, they cannot be generalized across all social media platforms. Each platform has distinct user bases and algorithmic characteristics that influence how content is spread and engages users. Additionally, the specificity of the sources analyzed\u2014news outlets\u2014and their content type must be considered. Focusing exclusively on news items offers the advantage of dealing with content inherently tied to specific topics or events, providing a concrete subject matter. However, the dynamics and peculiarities of the news agenda mean that these results may not necessarily apply to the broader spectrum of content creators. Future research should explore various social media platforms and content types to understand better the dynamics of virality and collective attention across different contexts. A more comprehensive picture of how virality functions in the digital landscape can be developed by expanding the study to include a different range of contents and creators.\nFuture research could further explore the impact of factors such as contextual relevance and emotional resonance on users\u2019 perceptions during viral events, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Sentiment analysis of user activity may offer valuable insights into the emotional dynamics driving viral diffusion. Additionally, a cross-platform approach leveraging audience demographics could enhance our understanding of user preferences. The analysis of multimodal data, such as videos and images, would also provide deeper insights into the spreading and engagement mechanisms of diverse content within the digital ecosystem.\nWe are unable to share the raw data obtained from CrowdTangle47.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nOn 7 June 2018, Neon Nettle \u2014 a web site that frequently weaves nonsensical allegations into its stories \u2014 pushed out a disingenuous article maintaining that we had \"ignored\" a huge child trafficking bust:\nSnopes has 'debunked' recent allegations of a child trafficking camp made by veterans even though it has been reported that the FBI has rescued 60 children as part of a massive pedophile ring bust.\nThe fact-checking site said that the story about the discovery of an Arizona child trafficking camp was completely \"false\" with all references to it on social media hidden.\nThe sting saw 150 child traffickers snared along with approximately 160 children rescued, some as young as 3 years old.\n\"They are crimes of special concern to the FBI and to law enforcement generally,\" [FBI special agent Matt] Alcoke said. \"Because the victims are so vulnerable as children and because the offenders could be from just about any walk of life, from a gang member all the way up to someone who is highly successful and wealthy.\"\nThis passage reproduced an accurate quote from a real FBI agent speaking about a legitimate trafficking bust \u2014 but that bust was part of an FBI sting operation which took place in Atlanta, 1,700 miles away from the site of the debunked \"child trafficking camp\" in Tucson. Neon Nettle deliberately and misleadingly conflated these two stories to make is seem as if we were disclaiming a successful child trafficking raid in Georgia rather than debunking a false report of child trafficking in Arizona.\nThe FBI sting in Atlanta, code-named Operation Safe Summer, was specific to the state of Georgia and had nothing to do with the false report of a \"child trafficking bunker\" allegedly discovered by a group in Arizona:\nNORTH FULTON COUNTY, GA. \u2014 A sting on the sex-trafficking trade in metro Atlanta netted dozens of arrests and the rescue of dozens of children forced into sexual servitude, the FBI announced this week.\nOperation Safe Summer was a collaborative effort between the FBI's Atlanta field office and 38 law enforcement agencies in six metro counties, assistant Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2's Mike Petchenik.\nThe Neon Nettle story was apparently sourced from fellow conspiracy theorists The Free Thought Project, who engaged in similar deceptive headlining:\nAs Snopes 'Debunks' Child Trafficking Camp, 160 Kids as Young as 3 Rescued in Georgia\nAfter Snopes called allegations of child trafficking made by a veterans group a 'conspiracy theory', 160 children, as young as 3-years-old, were rescued from traffickers in Georgia.\nFree Thought Project insinuated, in an impressive combination of logical fallacies, that because we (and others) debunked the false \"pedophilia bunker\" in Arizona story, we must not believe child trafficking exists anywhere in the world at all:\nSnopes \u2014 whether deliberately or not \u2014 is actively engaging in censorship of content that could actually help children by engaging others and fostering discussion. Instead of allowing the discussion to continue, Snopes deliberately shut down the conversation, insuring that the very important topic of child trafficking is forced into the memory hole and never heard of again.\nAs the above case illustrates, child trafficking is a horrifying reality. While Pizzagate scenarios may not be real, there are far worse incidents taking place across the country.\nChild trafficking is, indeed, a horrifying reality, which is why we choose to cover it responsibly rather than making the job of law enforcement and advocacy groups immeasurably more difficult by irresponsibly propagating false information about child trafficking (as sites such as Neon Nettle and the Free Thought Project do).\nFor example, the \"veterans' group\" that stumbled across the abandoned homeless camp on private property in Tucson decided that the presence of child's toys at one end of the camp and pornographic magazines elsewhere was obvious evidence of child sex trafficking, rather than ordinary detritus left behind at a temporary site where those migrating from one region to another chose to stop for a while and perhaps have a moment or two alone to tend to some rather common needs.\nThat group also decided (again, without any evidence) that straps tied around trees were \"restraints\" for holding children in bondage, rather than for some other more prosaic use, such as tying up tarps to provide shade from the relentless Arizona sun. When local and federal authorities investigated the site and found nothing but an abandoned homeless encampment, the same \"veteran's group\" immediately accused law enforcement of orchestrating a massive cover-up.\nThe Polaris Project provides information on recognizing genuine signs of human trafficking and responsibly reporting it. We recommend them as a resource, rather than clickbait-driven, irresponsible purveyors of misinformation.\nAgorist, Matt.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"As Snopes 'Debunks' Child Trafficking Camp, 160 Kids as Young as 3 Rescued in Georgia.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 The Free Thought Project.\u00a0 \u00a0 7 June 2018.\nNewton, Daniel.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"160 Children Rescued From Child Trafficking Camp 'Debunked' by Snopes.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Neon Nettle.\u00a0 \u00a0 8 June 2018.\n\"Recognize the Signs.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Polaris Project.\nBrooke Binkowski is a former editor for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Premium Vector | Black and white vector illustration of \u2026\nOur squad\nEnhanced solutions\nApps and plugins\nYou might also like these vectors\nCopyright \u00a9 2010-2025 Freepik Company S.L.

        "article_texts": "### Volcanic eruption in Iceland forces tourists to evacuate Blue \u2026\nWatch CBS News\nJuly 16, 2025 / 6:39 AM EDT / CBS/AP\nA volcanic eruption in southwestern Iceland has once again forced the evacuation of tourists at the internationally known Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, the national broadcaster RUV reported. The eruption began around 4 a.m. following an intense seismic swarm on the Reykjanes Peninsula, southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, Iceland's Met Office said.\nA campsite in the town of Grindavik was evacuated shortly after the seismic activity began. Guests at the Blue Lagoon were forced to quickly pack their bags, RUV reported.\nLava from the eruption is flowing southeast from a fissure in the barren landscape that is about 2,300 to 3,300 feet wide, but the molten rock isn't threatening any infrastructure, the Met Office said.\nGrindavik has been repeatedly affected by the activity since November 2023 when a volcano in the area came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years. There were at least\u00a0seven disruptive volcanic eruptions\u00a0during 2024. But authorities said Wednesday that the town was not in danger.\nAn eruption in early April also forced tourists to leave Blue Lagoon, and flames and smoke shooting into the air from the open fissure near Grindavik also prompted the evacuation of about 40 homes.\nIceland sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic and is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\nThe most disruptive incident in recent times was the 2010\u00a0eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted transatlantic air travel for months.\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Read our Privacy notice\nA volcanic fissure that opened up in Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes Peninsula expanded on Thursday after an eruption forced the evacuation of local residents and travellers staying at the famous Blue Lagoon spa.\nLava was still flowing on Thursday, after what officials say was the twelfth eruption in the region since 2021.\nThe volcano alert level will remain at the highest level until 3pm on Friday, Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office (IMO) said in their latest assessment.\nThe eruption on Wednesday prompted fresh evacuations from the nearby town of Grindav\u00edk, a luxury hotel, and the popular Blue Lagoon spa, Icelandic authorities said.\nJ\u00f6rd\u00eds Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir, communications director for civil protection, says that police were driving around the Blue Lagoon checking on people staying in houses.\n\u201cThere are quite a few people there,\u201d she said, according to The Mirror, adding that she didn't have an exact number of people staying in the area.\nOn Wednesday, the eruption sent glowing lava and columns of smoke into the air, with dramatic footage showing orange flows lighting up the dark volcanic landscape.\nThe outbreaks, known as fissure eruptions, are characterised by lava flows emerging from long cracks in the earth's crust, rather than from a central crater.\nThe crack in the ground now measures some 2.4 kilometres, with fresh lava now covering 3.2 square kilometres, according to officials.\n\u201c(It does) not threaten any infrastructure at this time,\u201d the IMO said in a statement. \u201cBased on GPS measurements and deformation signals, it is likely that this was a relatively small eruption.\u201d\nAuthorities moved swiftly to evacuate areas near the site. According to Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster RUV, guests were relocated from the Blue Lagoon resort and residents were cleared from Grindav\u00edk.\nClouds of gas were heading towards nearby communities in Vogar and Reykjanesb\u00e6r, Sandger\u00f0i and Gar\u00f0, local media reported. Residents were asked to close windows and monitor the air quality.\nThe town, once home to nearly 4,000 people, was evacuated in 2023 and has remained largely deserted ever since, due to repeated volcanic activity and earthquake threats.\nA large sulphur dioxide gas cloud was blowing toward Keflav\u00edk International Airport. Flights at Keflav\u00edk airport, about 20km away, were not affected as of Thursday evening, and no major disruption to air traffic was reported.\nThe eruption is the latest in a growing sequence of volcanic events on the Reykjanes Peninsula, which began when dormant systems were reactivated in 2021 after centuries of silence. Experts warn the region could now face periodic eruptions for decades or even centuries.\n\u201cThis is part of a new volcanic cycle,\u201d the IMO has previously said, referring to the Reykjanes system, where magma often emerges through long surface fissures rather than traditional crater eruptions.\nWhile past eruptions in the region have not ejected large volumes of ash into the stratosphere, the frequent lava flows and associated tremors continue to pose risks to infrastructure, geothermal plants, and communities in southwest Iceland.\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in",

It is one of the most overcrowded jails in the world.[1][3]\nThe Old Bilibid Prison, then known as Carcel y Presidio Correccional (Spanish, \"Correctional Jail and Military Prison\") occupied a rectangular piece of land that was part of the Mayhalique Estate in the heart of Manila.[4] The old prison was established by the Spanish colonial government on June 25, 1865, via royal decree.[5] It was divided into two sections: the carcel (jail), which could accommodate 600 inmates, and the presidio (prison), which could hold 527 prisoners.[4]\nIn October 1936, the Commonwealth of the Philippines allocated 1\u00a0million Philippine pesos to build a new prison in Muntinlupa on 551 hectares (1,360 acres) of land, in an area that was considered at that time to be remote.[6][7] Construction began the same year.[7]\nIn 1940, the prisoners, equipment and facilities were transferred from Old Bilibid to the new prison, which was named the New Bilibid Prison.[7] The remnants of the old facility became the Manila City Jail.[8]\nThe Manila City Jail began overcrowding at the start of the Rodrigo Duterte administration, during the crackdown on drug-related crimes.[1][3][9]\nIn September 2019, two inmates were killed and 32 were injured in a riot that began with an argument between two members of rival gangs over a sleeping space. At the time, the dormitory in the facility where the fight broke out was housing 800 inmates despite having a 200-person capacity.[10][11]\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread in 2020, a spokesperson for the Manila City Jail told ABS-CBN News that the jail was housing over four times its intended capacity, with 4,800 inmates in the facility. The jail began to allow inmates to stay in open spaces within the jail compound to increase physical distancing. Family visits were disallowed, and the jail added ten computers to allow for visits via video chat (e-dalaw). Jail employees were put under lockdown and not allowed to return home beginning March 20, 2020.[12]\nAn old building previously used to quarantine tuberculosis patients was established as an isolation location for potential COVID-19 patients.[2] The jail spokesperson told ABS-CBN towards the end of March 2020: \"As of now, Manila City Jail remains COVID-19 free\"; however, ABS-CBN noted that no one at the facility had been tested.[12]\nIn April 2020, the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch expressed the concern that, due to incomplete reporting by the Philippine government, COVID-19 might be spreading more quickly and widely within Philippine detention centers than it appeared.[13]\nThe 2.4-hectare (5.9-acre) Manila City Jail has the capacity to house 1,100 inmates.[1][10][12]\nOperating at an average of 463.6% occupancy, detention centers in the Philippines are the second most overcrowded in the world.[14] As of March\u00a02020, there were 4,800 inmates in the Manila City Jail. In December 2018, the Philippines topped the list of countries with the most overcrowded prisons, with the average facility population exceeding 600% capacity. At that time, the Manila City Jail was housing 6,300 inmates, 90% of whom were pretrial detainees.[1]\nIn December 2018, the ratio of guards to inmates was 1:200, considerably higher than international guidelines, which recommend a ratio of 1:7.[1] In January 2019, The New York Times reported that during one shift, the ratio was 1:528.[3]\nDue to overcrowding, inmates sleep in shifts.[2] Many sleep side by side on all available floor space and stairways, including in hallways and bathrooms.[1][3][2] Some do not have room to lay down, and must sleep sitting up.[1] Those who can afford it pay other inmates, who act as dorm leaders, to allow them to sleep in 2-by-2-meter (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a06\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) cubicles called kubols.[3][2]\nAlthough gangs are forbidden, officials allow them to operate because they help maintain order. In 2019, a spokesman for the Manila City Jail told The New York Times, \"Formally, we don't allow inmates to police other inmates. Informally, we do because of a lack of resources.\" The gangs self-enforce rules such as those forbidding fighting and approaching other inmates' visitors.[3] They also maintain communal funds and help distribute food, which is scarce within the facility.[1][3]\nLeah Armamento, a member of the Philippine government's Commission on Human Rights, has said that the overcrowding in Philippine jails constitutes torture according to the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture.[3]\nIn April 2020, the international NGO, Human Rights Watch, raised concerns that COVID-19 was spreading more quickly and widely in Philippine detention centers than reporting suggested, and urged authorities to investigate the causes of deaths in the facilities, reduce prison populations, and implement other measures to prevent the spread of the virus.[13]\nAmnesty International raised concerns the same month over the risk of Philippine prisons and detention facilities to become hot-spots of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amnesty urged authorities to release prisoners, saying their health is at immediate risk due to the lack of space, food, water, hygiene and health care. The massive overcrowding is partially due fact that roughly 75% of the detainees are pre-trial or remand prisoners. Many of them are being held without a trial for years, sometimes for minor offences.[15]\n\n### Human Rights Behind Bars:The Manila City Jail Experience\nfont size\nEnglish\nPowered by Google\nEnglish\nPowered by Google\nCLOSE\nPowered by Google\nMa. Rita Arce Alfaro\n- Ma. Rita Arce Alfaro is a law graduate who headed the Manila City Jail Project of the Far Eastern University Legal Aid Bureau (Philippines). She was an intern of HURIGHTS OSAKA.\nPerhaps the most inhuman act that society commits against prisoners is the blatant disregard for their rights. The thought that prisoners have human rights escapes most people. While part of a prisoner's punishment is deprivation of certain civil rights, every prisoner has rights mandated and protected by the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,[1] the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. However, in the face of all these international instruments, society persists in violating the human rights of prisoners by omission and apathy - neglecting to do what ought to be done and turning a blind eye on what needs to be addressed. The Philippine Jail System, particularly the Manila City Jail, exemplifies this situation.\nThe Manila City Jail currently accommodates close to 5,000 prisoners who are classified by law as detention prisoners, city prisoners and youth offenders. Within its walls are men, women, minors, people with mental illness, and those with health problems. Prisoners, both undergoing trial and convicted, are mixed together in this prison.\nSurrounded by a shopping mall and stores, railway stations, major streets and a university, the Manila City Jail seems incongruous to the idea of sequestering criminals away from society for the purpose of rehabilitation and reformation. Inmates are hardly removed from society when they are placed in the midst of the hustle and bustle of city life.\nWhile the Philippine government continues to initiate various projects and schemes on appropriate jail relocation such goal remains buried under the bureaucracy and suffers from lack of funding. Prison population increases as new laws provide for new offenses. The new Dangerous Drugs Act, which took effect in 2002 and provided for stricter penalties and lowered the threshold of offense necessary for arrest, caused the recent upsurge of prison population.\nThe Manila City Jail has four main compounds housing four groups divided along ethnic and gender lines. While men and women are housed in separate compounds, the juvenile delinquents are mixed with the adult prisoners, prisoners with mental illness are mixed with those who are mentally healthy, and the physically ill with the able-bodied. This is in direct contravention of the United Nations Standard for Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (UN Minimum Rules), which provides:\n8. The different categories of prisoners shall be kept in separate institutions or parts of institutions taking account of their sex, age, criminal record, the legal reason for their detention and the necessities of their treatment. Thus,\n\u00a0(a) Men and women shall so far as possible be detained in separate institutions; in an institution which receives both men and women the whole of the premises allocated to women shall be entirely separate;\n\u00a0(d) Young prisoners shall be kept separate from adults.\n82. (1) Persons who are found to be insane shall not be detained in prisons and arrangements shall be made to remove them to mental institutions as soon as possible.\n(2) Prisoners who suffer from other mental diseases or abnormalities shall be observed and treated in specialized institutions under medical management.\nEach compound has one main hall and one main dormitory. It is segregated from the other compounds by walls and fences. A dormitory, housing all the prisoners of the compound, has sparse facilities. Affluent inmates can pay for a space (called \"condominium\") that separates them from other inmates by wooden walls, and for 90 US dollars a spartan cot. The less affluent may avail of the \"apartment,\" a space shared by 2-4 people. Destitute inmates usually sleep on the sahig or floor with hardly any bedding. Rice or flour sacks, even newspapers, are utilized as bedding while pillows and blankets are rare. Again this situation violates the UN Minimum Rules which state clearly that:\nThe typical dormitory is cramped, poorly lit and with hardly any ventilation. It stinks even if cleaned and scrubbed with the harshest of disinfectants. The dormitory is blistering hot at most times of the year. Inmates fall easy prey to outbreaks of skin diseases such as boils, infections, and various allergies. Tuberculosis proliferates inside the prison walls.\nThe Manila City Jail was originally built to accommodate 1,000 inmates, and yet it currently houses approximately 5,000 inmates. Inmates take \"shifts\" in sleeping on the bare floors. During daytime, inmates could not slump or sit on the floor for lack of space. They are forced to stand all day long.\nThe daily budget allocated per inmate is merely 35 pesos (less than 1 US dollar). This amount covers three meals a day in addition to the budget for drinking water. The UN Minimum Rules state that:\nThe harsh reality is that the meal allowance cannot possibly be stretched to sustain a prisoner. Moreover, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology admits that with the increasing number of prisoners and detainees, the budget allocation would often be too thinly stretched in light of severe budgetary constraints in the government coffers.\nPrison food is usually comprised of rice, a basic staple, and viands (usually canned sardines). On lucky days when donations arrive, a variety of canned meats may be served along with vegetable stew. Variance in viands often depends on donations from family visitors or charitable organizations. Most donations pour in only during Christmas holidays.\nDue to limited food supply, the inmates are served rice mixed with sardines (or any other viand) from a cauldron. The inmates liken this to the way cows are fed in ranches, calling meal time as \"ranch time\" (oras ng rancho). The food has little nutritional value and prepared in unsanitary way. What is fed to the prisoner in the end would look like a feed, mush, or worse, slop.\nWith limited water supply due to non-functioning pipelines, personal hygiene and sanitation are highly compromised.\nA prison system facilitates punishment, retribution or retaliation, expiation, deterrence, and reformation, as well as the protection of society. But in many cases, these aims are not served. The prison system is constrained to punishment and retribution per se; with little regard for the reformation and rehabilitation of the offender. With the indifference to the plight of the prisoners, society yet creates more monsters out of them. The main thrust of present day prison system has not evolved from the time of the guillotine. But if urgent needs are to be addressed, reform in the prison system is a must.\nThe Manila City Jail experience symbolizes the present-day problems of the prison system.\nWhat are placed behind bars are not just the physical bodies but the fundamental human rights of prisoners as well. Prisoners, while viewed as sinners against society, are human beings too, something neglected by many.\nAs Fyodor Dostoevsky opined, \"A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens but by how it treats its criminals.\"[2] Let this be our guide.\n1.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nAn August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the\u00a0claim\u00a0that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a \"quiet\" admission that marijuana \"kills cancer\":\nIn just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.\nIn fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [sic] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been, and continues to be, used as source material for variations on a \"Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer\" clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites.\nThe \"report\" in question is the NCI's Physician Data Query (PDQ) on \"Cannabis and Cannabinoids.\" The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ:\nThe PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive, evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment, supportive and palliative care, screening, prevention, genetics, and integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies.\nPerplexingly, viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason. Both the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis, and both versions include phrases that could be loosely (and falsely) interpreted as \"marijuana kills cancer.\"\nThe earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version, and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the\u00a0 allegedly nefarious July 2015 update. Both include this statement in the \"overview section\":\nCannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory (see Question 6)\nThe mysterious Question 6 (the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells. That list includes studies on mice, rats, and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids (the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells\u00a0\u2014 including those found in colon, liver, and breast cancers. That list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018, save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017.\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article, their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet \"admission\" of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false. The PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment, but to claim that these changes were added \"quietly\" in 2015 is complete fiction.\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ \"prove\" that cannabis \"kills\" cancer. The studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials (or reviews of such trials), and therefore they do not \"prove\" anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans, which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be \"cured\" by a single chemical or group of chemicals. The number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious:\nThe organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing, and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves.\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act, meaning that the official position is that it has \"no currently accepted medical use,\" which limits research into its possible medical value. While the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification, they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment.\nFurther, a PDQ report, which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH, does not have any bearing on the United States Government's official view toward cannabis, and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups:\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research.

Cannabis and cannabinoids are advocated for a plethora of medical indications. An increasing number of medical and nonmedical users regularly consume large doses of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component of cannabis. Aim: to summarize the evidence on (1) risks\u00a0of recreational cannabis use and (2) effectiveness and\u00a0safety of medicinal cannabis. Findings on recreational use: Cannabis is\u00a0mostly used to experience its acute rewarding effects. Regular use of high THC products can produce addiction (cannabis use disorder or CUD). Acute consumption of high THC doses (including unintentionally) can cause time-limited mental, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular problems and motor vehicle accidents. Chronic patterns of cannabis use have been associated with multiple adverse outcomes that are of particular concern among adolescents and young adults, such as, disrupted learning, impaired cognitive performance, reduced educational attainment and an increased risk of CUD, psychosis/schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders and suicidal behaviors. There is debate about the extent to which cannabis use is a cause of these adverse outcomes. Physical health risks (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular, prematurity and restricted fetal growth, hyperemesis syndrome among others) have also been linked with repeated consumption of cannabis with a high THC content. Findings on medical\u00a0cannabis use: Herbal cannabis, medicines from extracted or synthetized cannabinoids\u2014often used as adjuvants to standard medicines\u2014may\u00a0produce small to modest benefits. This is primarily the case in treating chronic pain, muscle spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and refractory epilepsy (in the case of cannabidiol, CBD). The evidence is inconclusive on their value in treating mental disorders and other medical conditions. Safety: Cannabis-based medicine is generally well tolerated. There is a risk of mild to moderate adverse effects and CUD.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00406-024-01880-2.\nKeywords: Cannabis*/adverse effects, Cannabinoids*/therapeutic use, Humans, Medical Marijuana*, Marijuana abuse, Public health\nIn 2021, the UNODC estimated that 219 million people, 4.3% of the global adult population, had used cannabis [1]. Its nonmedical use has been prohibited under international drug control treaties since 1961. Cannabis consumption remains the highest in North America, where 17.4% of the population aged between 15 and 64 used it in the past year [2]. Prevalence rates are lower in Oceania (12.2%), West and Central Africa (9.7%) and Europe (7.8%) [2] with considerable variations between countries within these regions. The past 25\u00a0years have seen different policies towards cannabis use for medical or recreational purposes [3]. In the United States and Canada cannabis legalization has been accompanied by increases in the number of regular users who consume increasingly higher doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis) [4, 5]. The higher potency of cannabis products [6], diverse cannabis formulations and modes of administration (e.g., edibles, beverages, vaping, and dabbing) have raised concerns about the adverse public health impacts of cannabis legalization particularly when there is little or no regulatory oversight [7].\nWe have also seen a rapid development in the basic science of cannabinoids, including characterization and function of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the human brain and other organs, the pharmacology of cannabinoids, and therapeutic cannabinoid development [8]. Growing evidence indicates that dysregulation of ECS may contribute to brain dysfunction, psychopathology, neurodevelopmental problems, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation, among other physiological functions [9, 10]. The last decade has also seen a significant increase in scientific literature addressing the effects of cannabis and cannabinoids for recreational and medicinal purposes [11\u201313].\nTo guide policies regarding access and oversight for cannabis for recreational of medicinal purposes it is crucial to summarize the literature on the risks for recreational use and its therapeutic benefits. In this review we summarize (1) mental, physical, and social risks of cannabis when used as recreational drug and (2) the efficacy and safety of cannabis-based medicines.\nThis work aims to update a large systematic literature research on \u201cbenefits and risks of cannabinoids\u201d commissioned by the German Ministry of Health [14\u201318]. For this reason, we conducted a selective literature research in PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials. The search period was from 10.5.2016 to 10.5.2023. PubMed was searched with combinations of the mesh terms \u201cCannabis\u201d or \u201cCannabinoid\u201d or \u201cMarijuana\u201d or \u201cMedical Marihuana\u201d or \u201cMedical cannabis\u201d or \u201cPharmaceutical cannabis\u201d. Our search procedure gave priority to systematic reviews and meta-analyses of research on cannabis and cannabinoids, published in the past decade. In their absence, we included studies with the strongest research designs that had adequate statistical power and have been published since the most recent review. The references of the studies found were also screened to identify further relevant studies. We used the approach to causal inference outlined in Text Box\u00a01.\nApproach to causal inferences [19]\nAcute effects may occur shortly after a single occasion or infrequent cannabis use. Chronic use is defined as daily or near daily use over months or longer.\nCannabis is used recreationally because of its rewarding effects that are associated with decreased stress reactivity and an enhanced sense of well-being [11]. Rewarding affects can include positive effects e.g., euphoria and the relief of adverse experiences such as anxiety. These rewarding effects are linked with the agonist effects of THC at the cannabinoid CB1 receptor that drive THC\u2019s modulation of dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens, the main reward center in brain. The anxiolytic effects of cannabis are mediated both by THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in part through their effects in the amygdala. The doses of THC and routes of administration determine the magnitude of its rewarding and anxiolytic effects. Other neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators and individual metabolism differences also account for large differences in the effects of cannabis. At high THC doses, acute cannabis intoxication can produce unpleasant feelings (e.g. irritability, anxiety), distorted perceptions (e.g. paranoid thoughts, short-lived hallucinations, delusions or depersonalization) and dysfunctional behavior [20, 21]. Overdosing and unintentional cannabis use may cause short term psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular problems in children, teens, and adults [22, 23]. These unpleasant symptoms generally subside without the need for medical assistance but can require medical assistance in more severe cases.\nAcute cannabis consumption has consistently been associated with a modest increase in the risk of traffic accidents, with odd ratios ranging from 1.25 to 1.97 [17]. Measuring THC-related impairment and fitness to drive is more complicated than for alcohol because the absorption and bioavailability of THC does not follow a uniform time- and dose-dependent course and cannabis-related behavioral impairments differ from those of alcohol [24]. Thus, there are no reliable cut-off values for blood THC levels that indicate when an individual is impaired. Orally administered cannabis produces a protracted increase in blood THC concentration and prolongs impaired driving performance compared to inhaled cannabis. Frequent cannabis users may be less impaired because they may show tolerance to the motor incoordination and cognitive disruptive effects of cannabis. Recovery of driving-related skills appears to occur 5\u20136\u00a0h after cannabis intoxication but individuals may vary in the amount and duration of impairment [24]. The concurrent use of cannabis and alcohol produces greater driving impairment than cannabis alone [25].\nAcute intoxication with cannabis and cannabinoids (THC, THC/CBD extracts) increases disinhibition, and impairs verbal memory, other memory components, learning, attention, attentional bias, and psychomotor function [26, 27]. Acute intoxication has inconsistent effects on working memory, verbal fluency, executive function and time estimation.\nMost of these effects recover within hours or a couple of days but they can persist for longer time periods in chronic cannabis users. In non-intoxicated, current cannabis users, impaired cognitive performance shows small-to-medium effect sizes [26, 27]. The domains most consistently adversely affected are forgetting (retrieval/recall) and learning, global cognition, memory and cognitive impulsivity [26, 27]. There is emerging evidence for decrements in specific memory components (i.e., verbal, encoding, episodic and prospective), visual recognition and attentional bias [26, 27]. Other cognitive domains that were inconsistently impaired include attention, executive function/abstraction, working memory/updating, psychomotor function, decision making, verbal/language, processing speed, verbal fluency, and other memory components [26, 27]. There were no differences in simple reaction time, visuospatial learning, visual immediate memory, recognition, attention (sustained, divided) and time estimation [26, 27]. There is preliminary evidence of cognitive impulsivity and poorer verbal memory and visual recognition in older studies of recreational users [28].\nCognitive alterations in cannabis users appear to improve with abstinence. For example, when abstinence lasted longer than 42\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h and 25\u00a0days, cognitive function improved in most domains [26, 29]. Impairments that were more persistent after abstinence in some studies included impulsivity, verbal memory and fluency, working memory, performance in other memory domains; learning; attention, executive function and psychomotor function.\nCognitive performance was generally not affected by age, although cognitive impairments were worse in older people with psychosis (e.g., cognitive impulsivity, verbal memory, visual recognition) [28]. There is mixed evidence on the effects of the age of first cannabis use and duration of use on cognitive performance, except for IQ, which decreased by 2 points each year after the start of frequent/dependent use [30]. Emerging evidence indicates that heavier use, higher doses and higher frequency of cannabis use adversely affect cognition [26, 29].\nThere is partial support from longitudinal studies for a causal link between cannabis use and a reduction in motivation, that has been referred to as an \u201ca motivation syndrome\u201d [31]. It manifests as a reduce motivation to engage in everyday activities such as a diminished desire to study or work, engage in social or recreational activities people who use cannabis frequently [32]. A lack in motivation may also be related to decreased reward sensitivity. Mainly driven by striatal dysfunction in the brain, disrupted reward processing is a key characteristic in multiple types of addiction [33].\nEarly onset of cannabis use (<15\u00a0years of age) and frequent use in early adolescence are associated with lower educational achievement [34\u201336]. Low educational success includes early school dropout, lower rates of participation in university education and fewer academic degrees. Educational success is negatively associated with the age onset of cannabis use. There are inconsistent and limited data on antisocial behavior and psychosocial harm (e.g., family, professional and economic problems) [34]. The risk of physical violence is increased in regular cannabis users, especially in those with severe mental disorders [37, 38]. Risk of physical dating violence, victimization and perpetration is increased in female adolescent cannabis users and higher\u00a0among\u00a0alcohol users [39].\nResearch is showing that there are some individuals\u00a0who use cannabis to reduce symptoms of mood or anxiety disorders [40]. Regular cannabis use is associated with more depressive symptoms, and heavy cannabis use by youth and young adults predicts an increased risk of major depression [41]; twofold for cannabis misusers and threefold to fivefold for people with a CUD [42]. Regular cannabis use is associated with anxiety symptoms [41] and increased risk of anxiety disorders particularly during the withdrawal stage [43]. Emerging evidence found a non-significant association between chronic cannabis consumption and social anxiety disorders [44, 45] and another study showed that cannabis use did not impede recovery from panic disorder\u2019 when treated with other medications or treatments [46]. Risk of anxiety disorders is twofold higher in people who misuse cannabis, threefold to fourfold higher in those with a CUD [42, 45]. Associations between cannabis use and depressive or anxiety disorders were mixed in the reviewed studies, and weaker when analyses account for study quality, a diagnosis rather than symptoms of anxiety and early life psychosocial factors [43, 47]. Frequent cannabis use was associated with bipolar disorder and greater bipolar symptom severity, such as mania, rapid cycling, and mixed episodes [47]. There is strong early evidence that recent cannabis use is associated with negative long-term symptomatic and treatment outcomes across anxiety or mood disorders [46]. The literature is heterogeneous and associations may not be causal. Heavier and more frequent cannabis use was associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adolescents and young adults [48, 49]. The increases in suicide observed may reflect more impulsive behaviours. The causal pathways and mechanisms underlying the association between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and anxiety or mood disorders remain unclear [40].\nMeta-analyses of case\u2013control and cohort studies report a robust association between cannabis use and the risk of a psychotic disorder, and a dose\u2013response relationship between this risk and the frequency of cannabis use [16]. A multinational study in Europe and Brazil [50] found that daily use of high potency cannabis increased the risk of psychosis fivefold compared to non-users while daily use of low potency cannabis doubled the risk. Use less than once a week was not associated with a psychotic disorder risk (other than acute psychoses which can emerge even with first time consumption of high THC doses). The prevalence of daily cannabis use and high potency cannabis use was positively associated with the incidence of treated psychosis across study sites in Europe and Brazil. More recently, a study based on electronic record over 5 decades in the Danish population reported an increase in the incidence of schizophrenia associated with use of THC and CUD, predominantly among young males 20\u201330\u00a0years of age in whom cannabis use accounted for 30% of the cases [51].\nTriangulation of evidence from genetically sensitive research designs [52] indicates that the observed association may reflect in part a causal effect of cannabis use on schizophrenia. The risks of cannabis use are more severe for people who have psychotic disorders. In the laboratory, administration of THC increases psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia [53]. A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [54] found that continued cannabis use in people with psychosis is associated with an increased risk of relapse to psychosis and with longer hospital stays than in non-users [55].\nCUD refers to clinically significant impairment or distress associated with repeated cannabis use. Its symptoms include an inability to control use, persistent use despite harmful consequences, tolerance to the effects of cannabis, withdrawal symptoms, and craving [21]. Worldwide, 22 million people are estimated to meet criteria for CUD, similar in number to opioid use disorders (27 million people) [56]. It is estimated that 22% of people who ever use cannabis meet criteria for CUD, increasing to 33% in those who use weekly or daily [57]. Key risk factors include being male, of younger age [57] and using high-potency cannabis [58]. Increases in cannabis potency have been associated with a faster progression to first onset of symptoms [59]. Psychosocial treatments such as motivational enhancement therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and contingency management produce greater reductions in cannabis use than control treatments [60]. There are no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of CUD [61].\nThere is consistent evidence that regular cannabis use during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal anemia and neonatal problems such as reduced birth weight and the need for intensive care treatment [62]. Emerging preliminary evidence suggests that prenatal cannabis exposure may have subtle yet enduring effects on memory and achievement in children and adolescents [63]. There is limited evidence that some problems may persist into adulthood, such as delinquency, substance use and abuse, memory deficits, and psychotic symptoms [64].\nThere is consistent evidence of an association between acute cannabis smoking and bronchodilation and between regular cannabis smoking and respiratory symptoms of cough, wheezing, and phlegm [65]. It is unclear the extent to which these effects are due to cannabis alone or its combined used with tobacco or other confounders. THC vaping has been associated with pulmonary injury due to the contaminants in electronic cigarettes and vaping pens (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury or EVALI) [66].\nThree case\u2013control studies investigated the association between cannabis use and development of testicular germ cell tumors [67]. The strongest association was found for non-seminoma development and weekly cannabis use. The evidence is inconclusive for testicular seminomas, and lung cancer, neck and head cancers because of the possible roles of tobacco use, and other confounders.\nEffects of cannabinoids on cardiovascular parameters seem to be complex and differential. They affect vasculature and myocardium directly via specific receptors and exert indirect effects through the central and peripheral nervous system. THC acutely stimulates the cardiovascular system, increases heart rate and produces a change in blood pressure. This occurs primarily due to sympathetic nervous system activation and parasympathetic nervous system inhibition [68]. There are case reports of adverse cardiovascular risks in chronic cannabis users (e.g., myocardial infarctions, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) [68\u201370]. There is consistent evidence of a temporal association between the onset of cardiovascular events and both chronic and acute cannabis intoxication [71]. There is emerging evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome, especially in those with a history of cardiovascular events. There is a strong temporal link between cannabis exposure and the occurrence of stroke (i.e., ischemic), including chronic use and acute intoxication with onset ranging from \u201c24\u00a0h\u201d to \u201cdays before preceding the events\u201d [72]. Potential confounding effects of co-substance use (e.g., tobacco and alcohol) in studies need to be acknowledged. The endogenous cannabinoid system may also provide an array of potential benefits, particularly in the role of CBD as a neuroprotector for stroke [73]. Rigorous studies supporting these positive effects are missing [72].\nCannabis can cause recurring bouts of nausea, vomiting and intense abdominal pain amidst other acute gastrointestinal symptoms that are severe enough to prompt users to seek medical help [23]. These cyclical episodes occur with prolonged, high-dose cannabis use and are alleviated by hot baths and showers and abstinence from cannabis [74]. The mechanism are not well understood but the disruption of the endocannabinoid system is a possible contributing factor.\nCase\u2013control neuroimaging studies of the brain with high-resolution provide early evidence for altered brain integrity in brain regions with a high density of CB1 receptors in heavy cannabis users [75]. Specifically, chronic cannabis users have smaller volumes of the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in motivation, and the hippocampus, a brain area implicated in stress, learning and memory [32]. Cannabis users and people intoxicated with THC had altered function in the same regions and in brain striatal areas implicated in reward processing. These alterations were more consistently observed in persons with a history of chronic cannabis use [76].\nRisk of death due to cannabis toxicity is very low, but there is a link between cannabis use at high doses and lethal motor vehicle collisions, cardiac pathophysiology and possibly suicide [17, 77, 78]. It is unclear whether mortality is related to cannabis use, predisposing factors or combinations thereof.\nDue to their pharmacological properties, cannabis or cannabinoids are used for medical purposes (Table\u00a01) [79, 80]. The literature on therapeutic effects of cannabis is limited to studies of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).\nCannabis or cannabinoids used for medical purposes [79, 80]\nAnorexia with weight loss in AIDS wasting syndrome\nNausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, usually after previous treatments have failed\nSeizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients 1\u00a0years of age and older\nSeizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients 1\u00a0year of age or older\naApproved by FDA in the USA\nChronic pain includes neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and any pain in one or more anatomical region that persists or recurs for longer than 3\u00a0months and is associated with significant emotional distress or functional disability [20]. There is limited and inconsistent evidence that cannabinoids reduce chronic non-cancer pain by at least 30% but not more than 50% [81]. Cannabinoids may alleviate neuropathic pain in some patients [82], but there is insufficient evidence for other types of chronic pain [83, 84]. There is weak evidence for patient-perceived benefits [85]. Studies of the efficacy of cannabinoids for chronic pain treatment have usually been short-term (<12\u00a0weeks, partly only a few days) [86]. Cannabinoids have been administered as an oromucosal spray and combined with approved analgesics (e.g., opioids, anticonvulsants, or antidepressants) [82]. Mild to moderate central nervous or gastro-intestinal side effects are more common with cannabinoids than with placebo but severe side effects are rare [13]. Cannabinoids are recommended as second or third-line medications for chronic pain [87]. A large number of patients need to be treated to achieve a clinical benefit [81] and they are costly for patients [88]. There is also evidence that tolerance to the analgesic effects of cannabinoids develops with repeated use, which might limit their long-term benefits [89]. Medical cannabinoids may improve sleep in people living with chronic pain, but the magnitude of benefit is small [90].\nSome cannabinoids (nabiximols, dronabinol, oral and oromucosal THC and THC/CBD, medicinal hemp) have small beneficial effects on muscle spasticity, primarily in patients with multiple sclerosis and possibly in those with spinal cord injuries and motor neuron disease. Benefits were more evident on patient than on physician ratings of muscle spasticity [91, 92]. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, nervous system and psychiatric disorders [93]. Nabiximols are only recommended if other treatments are ineffective, and a 4-week trial produces at least a 20% reduction in spasticity-related symptoms [88].\nCINV is one of the few indications for which cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone, levonantradol, nabiximols) are approved by regulatory agencies such as the FDA in the USA. As an adjuvant treatment, they showed higher antiemetic effects than placebo or conventional anti-emetics [94]. These findings suggest that cannabinoids as promising therapeutic option for complicated CINV conditions (e.g., break-through, anticipatory or refractory). It should be pointed out here that newer antiemetics superseded many of the older antiemetics that cannabinoids were compared against. Only one RCT has compared cannabinoids to a guideline medication (ondansetron) for CINV prevention [95] and none compared them to new generation drugs (5-HT3- or NK1 antagonists or neuroleptics) [94].\nIn cancer anorexia cachexia syndrome patients\u2019 cannabinoid treatment did not significantly improve appetite, oral intake, or anorexia-related quality of life [96].\nCBD has recently been approved as Antiseizure medications for children and adults. A meta-analysis [97] shows that CBD is moderately efficacious both as standalone and adjunct therapy with clobazam for controlling refractory epilepsy in patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex.\nEffects of CBD-based cannabinoids are heterogeneous. THC-based effects on intraocular pressure are short-timed and reduced by the development of tolerance. Safe and effective drugs are already available on the market [98].\nTo date, only very few studies tested the effects of medicinal cannabinoids to improve symptoms of mental disorders, e.g. opioid dependence, cannabis use disorder, schizophrenia and schizophrenic psychoses, depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, anorexia nervosa, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [99], autism spectrum disorder [100, 101] or dementia [13, 15]. In these studies, THC and/or CBD were administered with other pharmacotherapies and/or psychotherapy [15]. The paucity of data does not allow any guidance on the therapeutic use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework [102].\nThe evidence for therapeutic benefit of cannabis-based medicine is weak or conflicting for other medical conditions (see eText Box\u00a02). Due to the role of the ECS in modulating inflammation, there is considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease [103].\nEfficacy of cannabis-based medicines: other medical conditions\nMedical uses of THC-based cannabinoids are associated with an increased risk of short-term adverse effects, but severe side effects are rare [13]. THC-based products may alter thinking and perception, produce dizziness, lightheadedness and sedation particularly in older adults [104]. CBD is not intoxicating and has fewer safety concerns than THC, but there is the potential for liver toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and there is poor regulatory oversight of CBD products [105]. THC and/or CBD increase SSRI concentrations in adolescents, and coadministration of CBD and SSRIs increases the risk of cough, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue [106]. A systematic review recently estimated the prevalence of cannabis use disorders in people who use medicinal cannabis is estimated at 25% (CI: 18\u201333%) [107]. This risk could be higher in people with chronic non-cancer pain, mental health or substance use disorders [107]. An overview of adverse events reported in medicinal cannabis studies, medicinal cannabis product information, and post-marketing adverse event data can be found elsewhere [108].\nCannabis is often used recreationally for its intoxicating effects and may have acute adverse health effects and impair the ability to safely drive a vehicle. More intense and prolonged patterns of use are linked with impaired: (1) educational attainment, (2) physical health (e.g., brain alterations, respiratory and cardiovascular risks, fetal damage, hyperemesis syndrome), (3) mental health (e.g., motivation, CUD, psychosis, mood and anxiety disorders), (4) suicide and mortality.\nThe increasing potency of cannabis products over the last few decades may increase the risk of addiction, impaired cognitive performance and mental disorders. It also appears to have increased the prevalence of overdosing, requiring emergency medical care. Though, the literature is sparse the evidence suggests that increased potency (higher THC concentrations) increases the acute and chronic adverse effects of cannabis.\nConfounding of cannabis use by tobacco and other drug use complicates the interpretation of evidence on the harmful long-term health effects of cannabis smoking. There is debate about the extent to which the association between cannabis use and health risks is causal. Case\u2013control and cohort studies are subject to unmeasured confounding\u2014a limitation which may be overcome using genetically sensitive designs. More rigorous data is needed on health outcomes associated with increased cannabis potency, diversity of cannabis products and new routes of administrations.\nEvidence on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis is limited to a few conditions and cannabinoids have been approved as therapeutics for a handful of indications. Strongest evidence for therapeutic benefit has been shown for CBD as an adjunctive treatment for intractable epilepsy in children and adults. THC may have benefits in improving spasticity, chronic pain, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The evidence base is inconclusive or too small to give treatment recommendations for neuropsychiatric disorders and other medical conditions. A major challenge in clinical trials is the absence of \u201cstandard\u201d cannabinoids. The multiple preparations tested (e.g., dronabinol, Sativex spray, smoked cannabis flower) include different cannabinoids (e.g., THC, THC/CBD, CBD). Varied modes of use complicate standardized dosage and comparability in intra- and interindividual effects. Cannabinoids are also commonly used in addition to standard medications. This makes it difficult to estimate the effects of \u201cpure\u201d cannabinoids and drug-drug interactions, as seen for THC and/or CBD and SSRIs in adolescent patients. Cannabinoids are commonly well tolerated. In comparison with placebo, they have more adverse effects, which are transient and not severe in most cases. The metabolism of cannabinoids varies greatly between subjects in time course and quantity, so the same dose of cannabinoid can deliver different levels of bio-available cannabinoids to different patients, producing varied therapeutic effects and non-response.\nThose countries that decide to legalise recreational\u00a0adult use of cannabis should regulate production, sales and promotions of cannabis use in ways that delay cannabis use among youth and minimize the regular use of cannabis products with high doses of THC. They should also consider funding more robust research on the short and long-term effects of cannabinoids. Public education about the risks and the benefits of medical and nonmedical cannabis use should be a high policy priority. In locations where the recreational purchase of cannabis is legal, the general public and especially vulnerable individuals (e.g., pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with health problems) should also be informed about the risks of self-medication. Clinicians administering cannabinoids need to be mindful of patients\u2019 cardiovascular risks and vulnerability to stroke. Doctors should take into account the risk of cannabis use disorder and other adverse effects\u00a0when prescribing cannabis or cannabinoids for mental or physical health problems.\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nAll authors contributed to the manuscript.

Here's what \u2026\nFor decades, cannabis has been studied for its potential antitumor properties, but whether it can actually treat cancer is still unknown.\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nResearch into the potential medical benefits of cannabis has exploded in recent years, raising one intriguing question: Could cannabis treat cancer?\nIt may sound far-fetched that weed \u2014 the high-inducing plant that propagandists once warned would cause \"reefer madness\" \u2014 could contain ingredients that shrink tumors. However, experts told Live Science that there is some early evidence that some cannabinoids, the active ingredients found in cannabis, do have anticancer effects.\n\"There's no two ways about it: [Cannabis] has anticancer properties,\" Wai Liu, a senior research fellow at St George's, University of London, told Live Science. \"But the problem is, how do you translate that into the clinic \u2014 and that's the difficult question to address.\"\nHere's what we know so far about Mary Jane's cancer-fighting powers.\nRelated: Runners enjoyed their workouts more after using cannabis, but physically floundered\nThe cannabis plant comes in more than 700 varieties, with famous examples including Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica. Cannabis plants contain substances called cannabinoids, or chemicals that interact with the endocannabinoid system in the brain. Endocannabinoids made by the body help regulate a plethora of biological functions, including eating, learning and pain recognition.\nPlant-made cannabinoids, of which more than 100 have been identified by scientists, plug into this same system and affect its activity. These plant-made molecules include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is largely responsible for the characteristic \"high\" associated with cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), which doesn't produce a high but has been studied for its potential medicinal effects.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThese and other cannabinoids can now be made synthetically in the lab, as well. In fact, two drugs that contain synthetic THC \u2014 dronabinol and nabilone \u2014 are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the nausea and vomiting triggered by chemotherapy.\nHowever, research studying whether cannabinoids directly shrink tumors is in its very early days. At this point, it's been mainly limited to preclinical studies in human or mouse cells in lab dishes and in animals such as mice. For instance, synthetic and plant-made cannabinoids have been shown to impede the growth of breast cancer in mice; in these experiments, cannabinoids were injected into the area directly around the tumor, as well as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and skin cancer in cells.\nThere are several ways in which cannabinoids have been shown to have anticancer properties, Liu said. For example, in rodent studies, cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth by flipping specific molecular switches in tumor cells. And in cell studies, cannabinoids have damaged tumors by flooding them with harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species, he said.\nHowever, it's not all positive \u2014 under certain circumstances, THC has been shown to promote tumor growth in animal models. These differences could partly be explained by studies using varying doses and investigating distinct types of cancer, the authors suggested.\nRelated: Cannabis poisonings in young kids skyrocketed following legalization of edibles\nFor any cannabinoid-based cancer treatments to reach the market, they'd need to be tested in humans.\n\"There's a big difference between what you observe in a cell line in a petri dish compared to what will happen if you treat a human who has that cancer,\" Dr. Mikael Sodergren, head of the Medical Cannabis Research Group at Imperial College London, told Live Science.\nHowever, so far, there have been only a few small clinical trials, and all have focused on just one type of cancer: glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer. Current treatments for glioblastoma have poor survival rates meaning that new approaches are urgently needed.\nIn the first trial, conducted in 2006, scientists showed that THC injections directly into the tumors of patients with brain cancer could safely and effectively inhibit their growth. The trial included just nine patients with glioblastoma. So, although these results were encouraging, the sample size of the study was too small to make any firm conclusions about the drug's safety and efficacy.\nIn 2021, a separate research group published the results of another early clinical trial, which included 27 people. One group of participants used a mouth spray containing a mixture of CBD and THC in combination with a traditional chemotherapy drug called temozolomide. They received between 3-12 sprays a day (up to 30\u2009milligrams of CBD and 32.4\u2009mg of THC), depending on their maximum tolerated dose. All of the patients had glioblastoma that had returned following standard, first-line therapy.\nThis trial included a comparison group that did not use the cannabinoid spray, and by comparison, almost twice as many patients who received the spray were alive after one year.\nIt's still unknown how the spray may affect tumor growth, but it's possible that these compounds help push brain tumor cells toward cell death, thereby enhancing the antitumor activity of temozolomide, Dr. Susan Short, a professor of clinical oncology at the University of Leeds in the U.K. who led the research, told Live Science.\nThe centres that are running the study are now aiming to recruit around 240 patients into a larger, midstage clinical trial. They hope to be able to share the results of that trial within two years from now, Short said.\nDespite this progress, many questions remain about how cannabinoids might fight cancer at the molecular level, as well as which dosage and administration route would work best in humans.\nAnd, if approved as a cancer treatment, THC would likely have to be combined with another form of cancer therapy, because only low doses could be given to patients to avoid inducing a high, he said. In clinical trials, it would also be unethical to exclude proven treatment methods from patients, so testing the effects of cannabinoid treatment by itself could be tricky.\nIn the meantime, the positive signals scientists have seen in cellular models are certainly worth investigating further, Dr. Brooke Worster, an assistant professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Pennsylvania, told Live Science. Such studies could help clarify how cannabinoids affect cancer cells and which are most promising as treatments.\n\u2014Cannabis is no better than a placebo for treating pain, 20 studies show\n\u2014Genetic risks behind 'cannabis use disorder' found in huge study\n\u2014CBD reportedly discovered in plant that's not cannabis\nIn the meantime, though, patients should take the results of these studies with a grain of salt, she said. No one should use the early data about cannabinoids to avoid taking treatments that are already known to be effective against cancer, such as immunotherapy and radiation therapy, she said.\nThere's a misconception that \"natural\" treatments are always better for you. But given that there isn't gold-standard proof that cannabinoids can treat cancer, opting for weed over chemo wouldn't be advisable, Worster added.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Luckily, instead of plunging 33 feet and crashing into the ground below, the car landed precariously on an enormous sculpture of whale tails that flanks the end of the tracks.\nThe train operator, who was the only person on board at the time of the crash, was able to free himself from the wreckage and sustained no injuries, writes Daniel Boffey for the Guardian. As first reported by Dutch news agency Media TV, the accident occurred at the De Akkers station in Spijkenisse, a suburb of Rotterdam, around 12:30 a.m. local time. No other people were harmed in the incident.\nOfficials don\u2019t yet know the cause of the accident, but they\u2019ve launched an investigation to determine how the train\u2019s safety features failed, Ruud Natrop, a spokesman for safety in the Rotterdam-Rijnmond area, tells Isabella Kwai and Claire Moses of the New York Times. Police interviewed the conductor but found no indication that he had done anything wrong, Natrop adds.\nBy mid-morning Monday, word of the crash had spread, and dozens of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the spectacular near-disaster. As the Associated Press reports, local authorities urged crowds to disperse, reminding them that Covid-19 precautionary measures were still in effect.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the scene of a Hollywood movie,\u201d Natrop tells the Times. \u201cThank God the tail was there.\u201d\nNow-retired architect Maarten Struijs designed the sculpture\u2014which consists of two large whale tails raised about 33 feet above the ground\u2014in 2002. Coincidentally, notes Agence France-Presse (AFP), the artwork is named Saved by the Whale\u2019s Tail. It riffs on the idea of a \u201ctail track,\u201d the phrase used to describe the bit of track where trains park at the end of service, reports Dutch news website DUIC.\nStruijs tells DUIC that he received a phone call notifying him of the accident while reading the newspaper with his morning cup of coffee. He expressed shock that the sculpture, which is made of reinforced plastic, was able to support the weight of the train car.\n\u201cI could never have imagined it that way, but it saved the operator\u2019s life,\u201d Struijs tells Dutch broadcaster RTL. \u201cThe damage is an afterthought,\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cI am amazed that it is so strong. \u2026 When plastic has stood for 20 years, you don\u2019t expect it to [hold up] a metro train.\u201d\nSpeaking with Dutch broadcaster NOS, Struijs says that the image of the damaged metro balancing on his sculpture resembles, in his eyes, \u201ca work of art in itself.\u201d He notes that photos of the scene remind him of Rode BMW (or Red BMW), a 1987 conceptual art piece by Kunst & Vaarwerk that features a life-size red car protruding through a parking garage wall as if frozen mid-fall.\nAs of Tuesday morning, an operation to salvage the train with two large cranes was ongoing, writes the Associated Press in a separate report. On Monday, Carly Gorter, a spokeswoman for the local security authority, told the AP that officials were working to figure out how to safely extract the train from its perch.\nThe removal will be \u201ctricky,\u201d noted Gorter.\nPhotographer Joey Bremer arrived at the scene shortly after the crash. His images of the lofted metro car won viral acclaim on Twitter; as Bremer tells the Times, he woke up on Monday to thousands of retweets and hundreds of messages.\n\u201cI stood there full of disbelief,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for about years, but this is one to remember. You can\u2019t make this up.\u201d\nNora McGreevy |  | Read More\nNora McGreevy is a former daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

That\u2019s according to Men\u2019s Corner, a website that claims to provide \"a measured dose of humor\" and \"the latest information from all the fields which can be significant for the modern man.\"\nThe article doesn\u2019t have a date but the earliest comment is from Oct. 7, 2017, and it was recently revived on social media. This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\"Man dug tunnel from home to the pub and drank every night while his wife slept,\" the headline says. The determined human excavator\u2019s name is Patsy K., according to Men\u2019s Corner. He is a plumber from Omagh, in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, who was inspired to build his own secret tunnel after watching the 1994 film, \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" In that movie, an inmate played by actor Tim Robbins methodically burrows a tunnel out of the prison to find freedom.\nAccording to Men\u2019s Corner, Patsy K. spent 15 years burrowing under his bed to his local bar 800 meters away. His stunt was discovered after he accidentally hit a sewage pipe, causing it to blow under his neighbor\u2019s house. That\u2019s when Patsy K. received a court summons, the story says.\nUsing a form provided on Men\u2019s Corner\u2019s website under \"Contact Us,\" we sent an email seeking more information about the story. Someone replied under the name \"Tesanj Teslic,\" which are towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\"Hi Ciara, I work for Men\u2019s Corner,\" the person wrote. \"This is an old post, the source we used no longer exists for some reason, so it can turn out that this story is not quite true. But you can check in the Omagh County Court (Northern Ireland) where this allegedly happened.\"\nA spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunal Service Press Team said officials couldn\u2019t search for current or disposed cases without the full name of the defendant, the court that they appeared and the time period when the case would\u2019ve been heard. Other stories give the plumber\u2019s full name as \"Patsy Kerr,\" but it\u2019s unclear what court may have heard his case. The Police Service of Northern Ireland responded to an email inquiry and asked for more details about the alleged plumber\u2019s crime but did not immediately provide more information about this story.\nVariations of the story appear online, including on Tyrone Tribulations, a website that notes \"accuracy cannot be guaranteed.\" Buzzfeed posted its own version in 2014, replete with a gif of Tim Robbins standing with his arms outstretched in the rain. \"This man dug a tunnel to the pub using a spoon,\" the headline said. Alas, the writer had to update the story the next morning.\n\"We messed up,\" the addendum says. \"The story is a hoax, and we fell for it. We\u2019re really sorry. Original story follows.\"\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!\nThe Principles of the Truth-O-Meter\nMen\u2019s Corner, \"Man dug a tunnel from home to the pub and drank every night while his wife slept,\" Oct. 7, 2017\nTyrone Tribulations, \"Omagh\u2019s \u2018Shawshank Husband\u2019 dug tunnel from bedroom to pub over 15 years,\" Sept. 25, 2014\nBuzzfeed, \"This man dug a tunnel to the pub using a spoon\u2014updated,\" Sept. 27, 2014\nBoing Boing, \"Fake: Man digs tunnel from bedroom to pub,\" Sept. 29, 2014\nIn a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\nSign me up\nDistrict of Columbia\n1800 I Street NW\nWashington, DC 20006\nFlorida\n801 3rd St. S\nSt. Petersburg, FL 33701\n727-821-9494",

His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\"\nWhile the story received some attention after it was first published, it reached a larger audience on 16 September 2016 when it was copied word for word by the disreputable\u00a0web site\u00a0BostonLeader.com,\u00a0with the exception of the location and the man's name. \u00a0BostonLeader.com does not carry a disclaimer on its web site, but has previously published hoax\u00a0news stories (such as its claim that a China zoo had named a baby gorilla Harambe McHarambeFace).\nUnlike the more recent version,\u00a0IsThatLegit.com\u00a0\u2014\u00a0where the story originated \u2014 clearly states that its content is fictional:\nAll content is for entertainment value only.

But the growing number of stray cows is proving to be a bane for both Indians and their bovine gods.\nFor many Hindus, who make up nearly 80 percent of India's 1.3 billion strong population, the cow is a sacred animal. In Hindu mythology, the animal is depicted as accompanying several gods, like Shiva, who rides on his bull Nandi, or Krishna, the cowherd god.\nIn ancient Hindu texts, the cow appears as \"Kamdhenu\"\u00a0or the divine cow, which fulfils all desires. Its horns symbolize the gods, its four legs, the ancient Hindu scriptures or the \"Vedas\"\u00a0and its udder, the four objectives of life, including material wealth, desire, righteousness and salvation.\nRead more:\u00a0India: Mob lynches Muslim man accused of cow smuggling\nModern cow protection groups, also known as \"Gau Rakshak\"\u00a0in Hindi, subscribe to this version, hailing the cow as a divine being that deserves protection. The\u00a0cow protection group \"Gau Rakshak Dal Haryana\"\u00a0refers to ancient texts and scholars, claiming that the cow is like a mother and should not be slaughtered.\nMumbai-based group called \"Serve Cows\"\u00a0says on its website, for example, that cows provide different products for human use, namely, milk, butter, dung, and urine, which the group claims has anti-fungal and anti-cancer properties \u2013 none of which has\u00a0been conclusively proven by scientists.\nRead more:\u00a0How foul air in India is putting people's lives in danger\nThese religious considerations have led to stringent laws and a rise in the numbers of cattle protection groups, spurred by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nEspecially since the enforcement of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (regulation of livestock markets) rules in 2017, the sale of cattle to slaughterhouses for use as meat or leather has become very difficult. The law has also severely impacted several communities involved in such businesses, including lower caste Hindus, for whom beef is a cheap and important source of food.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nUdder chaos?\nNearly 6 million cows roam freely on India's roads, according to the 2012 livestock census and the number is expected to go up substantially in the next livestock report, due later this year. The numbers have caused a rise in incidents of traffic accidents involving cows that have been reported in the last couple of years, although comprehensive statistics on the problem are still missing.\nAccording to Arjun Sheoran, advocate and the head of the People's Union for Civil Liberties in the northern city of Chandigarh, the changes in cow protection laws and their harsh implementation have led to an exponential rise in the number of stray bovines. People, who cannot afford to look after their cows after they stop producing milk, are forced to leave the animals on the streets. Thus, \"many cows, which are abandoned, end up in urban areas where they create massive traffic and public health and hygiene issues,\"\u00a0Sheoran told DW.\nRead more:\u00a0Can India take the lead on Asia's renewable energy future?\nIn West Bengal, for example, authorities intensified a cattle seizure drive earlier this year after reports that a car lost control because its driver was trying to avoid hitting a cow. In Noida, north of the capital New Delhi, a 22-year-old man died after his motorcycle collided with a stray cow. Cows themselves have been victims of traffic accidents, with nearly 7,000 animals dying on railway tracks in India's Uttar Pradesh since April this year, according to data collected by the North Central Railway.\nSaving the \"Mother\"\nLegislators in India, backed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, have announced steps to protect stray cows. Most recently, the government of India's Himalayan state, Himachal Pradesh said it was passing a resolution to declare the cow the \"national mother.\"\nAnirudh Singh, the political leader who proposed the resolution said, \"The\u00a0cow is not bound to any caste, creed or religion and makes a huge contribution to humanit ... People abandon cows when they stop giving milk so there is need for such a move,\"\u00a0the leader told the newspaper, Times of India.\nSingh hopes the resolution will help create more cattle shelters and spur legislation to stop cow-related lynching, although that has not proven to be effective in other regions.\nMany states like Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab have established cow shelters, however these are\u00a0stretched beyond their capacities, according to local administrative bodies.\u00a0 States like Uttar Pradesh have decided to invest in radium bands for stray cows, making it easier for pedestrians and other traffic users to spot the beasts.\nRead more:\u00a0Should we bring extinct species back from the dead?\nExperts like Sheoran,\u00a0however, are sceptical of such measures. \"There aren't enough gaushalas [cattle shelters] to take care of such increased number of cows and most of the expenditure by the government seems to be for criminal cases, like targeting Muslims and Dalits instead of creating proper infrastructure for the care and protection of cows and other animals,\"\u00a0Sheoran says, referring to recent cases where Hindu mobs killed people for allegedly eating beef or slaughtering their cattle.\nBut for the authorities, cows seem to be a more pressing matter than humans. Recently, a police officer in Uttar Pradesh was killed while investigating an incident of alleged cow slaughter, as the local government continued to focus on preventing the killing of cows.\nUntil a few months back, states like Haryana had 16 members in its \"Gau Seva Ayog,\"\u00a0or cow service committee Sheoran says, adding, \"The state human rights commission had none.\"\n\n### India\u2019s 5 million stray cows are sacred\u2014and a growing nuisance\nAnimals\nHistory & Culture\nTravel\nHealth\nScience & Nature\nLifestyle\nShows\nSally\nDavid Blaine: Do Not Attempt\nJaws @ 50\nSecrets of the Penguins\nView All\nMore\nVisit Nat Geo Kids\nNat Geo on Disney+\nGift a Subscription\nIn India, wayward cattle are trampling crops, spreading disease, and causing car accidents. They\u2019re also venerated.\nGURGAON, INDIA \u2014 Across India, farmers are becoming their own night security guards\u2014patrolling their harvest and checking on fences or trenches surrounding their land. But their enemies aren\u2019t robbers. They\u2019re stray cattle\u2014and there are more than\u00a0five million\u00a0of them.\n\u201cA herd can destroy the whole crop in just one hour,\u201d says Anjani Dixit, district head of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, a farmer association\u00a0in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Cattle can also become aggressive when threatened: Dixit says the horned animals fatally gored two men in his village.\nStray livestock, which gather at garbage dumps and weave through traffic, lead to thousands of road accidents each year; between 2018 and 2022, they caused more than 900 human deaths in the northern state of Haryana. In some states, authorities even paste glow-in-the-dark stickers on the animals to warn drivers at night.\nHow did India get here? Many livestock owners abandon male calves soon after they're born, keeping the females, which provide valuable milk and calves. In years past, farmers would deploy the males to plough their fields and use their dung as manure. But nearly every farmer now uses tractors, while manure has been replaced with chemical fertilizers, says Krishna Chauhan, a veterinary officer in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s capital Lucknow.\n\u201cThe utility of the male calf has become almost zero,\u201d he adds. In addition to setting the male calves free, farmers also starve male calves to death or, on big cattle operations, let the animals overeat until they die, says Chauhan. Sometimes, old and unproductive females also become strays. (Read about a boom in people are adopting India\u2019s stray dogs.)\nCompounding the problem, cow slaughter is banned in most states because Hindus\u2014who make up the dominant religion in India\u2014consider the animal sacred. The state-run Animal Welfare Board of India even wanted to rebrand Valentine\u2019s Day this year as \u201cCow Hug Day.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a bit ironic that, supposedly, we [Indians] are cow lovers and we have the worst animal welfare problem,\u201d says Navneet Dhand, associate professor in veterinary biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Sydney. For instance,\u00a0many stray cattle are in poor health, with a gaunt appearance and infected wounds from being hit by vehicles.\nFortunately, there are several new solutions in the works, from selecting female calves through artificial insemination to keeping cows on sanctuaries, experts say.\nA stray cow is problematic enough; a stray sick cow presents another challenge entirely.\n\u201cThere is no compensation for culling [diseased cows], so [farmers] will either sell them off to another farmer, which leads to spreading infections, or they will abandon them on the streets,\u201d says Dhand.\nCattle can spread zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis to people, which can cause flu-like symptoms. Stray cattle likely helped fuel an outbreak of lumpy skin disease, a virus that ravaged over two million domestic animals in several Indian states in 2022. (Learn what makes an animal feral.)\nWhile local laws allow veterinarians to euthanize sick cows, research suggests that it is culturally problematic and rarely happens. In recent years, cows have become a sensitive political topic, with Hindu mobs lynching people on suspicion of possessing beef or smuggling cows. As a result, veterinarians are scared to recommend euthanization, says Dhand.\nA few years ago, Uttar Pradesh introduced mandatory ear tags for cattle, which would ideally lead to nabbing the owners who deserted them. But it didn\u2019t work.\n\u201cCattle owners would rip the tag off along with the animal\u2019s ear,\u201d says Chauhan.\nHowever, the farmers don\u2019t deserve all the blame, says Dhand, as many of them see the animals as family members. The biggest problem is a lack of clear guidelines for handling unwanted cattle, he adds.\n\u201cWe need to give farmers some options. They are running a business in the end.\u201d\nRanjit Singh, who owns over a hundred cattle on his dairy farm in Punjab, a state in northern India, says unproductive animals quickly become a \u201cburden.\u201d He also admits that abandoning them is morally wrong. (Read more about the future of livestock farming.)\nThat\u2019s why, to minimize the chances of male calves being born, he\u2019s been using sex-sorted semen to artificially inseminate his cows. It\u2019s a technique that guarantees the birth of a desired sex by up to 95 percent. India\u2019s government has called it a \u201cgame changer.\u201d But the imported technology is expensive\u2014as much as a hundred times costlier than using conventional semen.\nIn December, the government of Kerala in southern India launched a scheme to distribute sexed semen at subsidized rates with the promise of a refund in case of failure. Several states have announced similar discounts.\nIndia\u2019s National Dairy Development Board is also working on its own, cheaper technology for sex-sorting semen. Deep Nagaraj, a representative from their facility in Tamil Nadu, says that the Indian semen technology should hit the market in about three years.\nYet there\u2019s another limitation, says Chauhan, the veterinarian: Sexed semen has a low conception rate. A dose of sexed semen contains two million sperm, as compared with 20 million in regular semen. If farmers don\u2019t see a return on their investment, they\u2019re skeptical of shelling out extra cash. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal if I can convince even one out of 10 farmers to buy sexed semen,\u201d says Chauhan.\nIn the meantime, India is witnessing a boom in gaushalas\u2014or cow shelters\u2014run by the government or religious institutions who care for abandoned cattle throughout their lives. There are more than 5,000 gaushalas in India, and in Uttar Pradesh, the government has announced the creation of a 130-acre cow sanctuary, as large as nearly a hundred football fields. (Learn what you should know before visiting an animal sanctuary.)\nThe Indian government is also promoting a \u201cgaushala economy\u201d\u2014turning cow dung and urine collected from such facilities into useful products. According to Ayurveda, or traditional Indian medicine, cow dung and urine have beneficial properties. Though there is almost no scientific evidence that is true, such products have become more popular recently in India.\nVallabh Kathiria, a politician from the national\u00a0ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and former chairman of a government agency to promote and protect cows, told National Geographic he envisions a future in which \u201cpeople see a stray cow on the road and feel like they\u2019ve found a gold ornament.\u201d In his view, the key is changing people\u2019s perception of stray cattle from burden to opportunity.\nCopyright \u00a9 1996-2015 National Geographic Society\nCopyright \u00a9 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

It can also elicit various reactions, whether amazement or fear or even anger, depending on what we wear.\nMeet James Maina Mwangi, a man from Nairobi, Kenya who became well known for his unique sense of style. The man has hundreds of bright and vibrant outfits that he wears on a daily basis, effectively covering the entire color palette. Everything from his suits, hats, and ties to phone cases and other accessories are color-coordinated, and it\u2019s mesmerizing to watch.\nBored Panda invites you to check out some of the best outfits that Mr. Mwangi sports when on the streets of Nairobi. And while you\u2019re scrolling, why not vote and comment on the ones that you liked the most?\nThis post may include affiliate links.\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nThe matching phone cases!\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nAwsome!\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nThis looks good\n\u201cMy name is James Maina Mwangi, I was born in Central Kenya, living in Nairobi, and born again Christian. I love Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who brought me from nothing to something from nowhere to somewhere,\u201d said Mwangi in an interview with Bored Panda.\nBack in 2018, James Maina Mwangi did a short interview with BBC where he explained that he owns over 160 suits with 300 plus caps and 200 pairs of shoes. All of this is besides the shirts, ties, and numerous other accessories like phone cases, pens, and watches that are also all color coordinated to make him look extremely stylish. He went as far as to claim that he's the smartest looking man in Africa, if not the whole world.\nThe bright and vibrant colors make him stand out in the crowd. In fact, his outfits are so out there that he\u2019d probably stand out regardless of whether it\u2019s in Nairobi, London, New York or Beijing. Who wouldn\u2019t notice a man wearing a green suit with green shoes, green shirt, green cap, green handkerchief, green pen, green phone cover, green face mask (since the pandemic started), and green underwear, though the last of these is not something people would notice in this case.\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nAnd his rings!\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nHell yeah!\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nAlligator? or Snake? shoes. These aren't horrible and will work with a multitude of different looks.\nBecause of his choice of style, Mr. Mwangi said he might be the smartest looking man in all of Africa, if not the world. They say that such matters ought to be left to the eye of the beholder, but regardless he has drawn the attention of many.\nMr. Mwangi explained that Nairobi locals would laugh at how he dressed because they knew his father - a freedom fighter who was poor - which makes it a rather stark contrast, not just visually but contextually. Mr. Mwangi always wanted to be different from other people, and his unique fashion was an answer that God provided him with.\n\u201cI left school when I was 12 years old. I decided to go to Nairobi to hustle because my father was a freedom fighter there. When they finished building the walls, the government didn't recognize them with no options, no money, no land, or jobs. I became a street child for about 5 years before I get a job in a kiosk,\u201d explained Mwangi his origins.\nHe continued: \u201cSo, I was praying to Jesus Christ to give me wisdom. I had just one shirt, one pair of trouser, washed it with water only. Many people we're showing love to me because of this, but others were abusive. I had a vision that one day I will be a star in Jesus\u2019 name. And he delivered. He blessed me with three different gifts: Test, Choice and Wisdom\u2014gifts that you can't buy with money.\u201d\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nThese shoes really do 'crack the mold'\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nLove the hat!\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nmatching items: suit, shoes, phone case, glasses, pen, ring, hat, and mask. There's usually also a matching watch, so i'm gonna guess that too.\nOthers, on the other hand, found his style full of swag. Twitter user luvthispayne recently shared a handful of Mr. Mwangi\u2019s photos explaining how \u201cdrip\u201d (an adjective to describe one\u2019s outfit similar to swag, sauce, steez, or swank, according to the Urban Dictionary) he was.\nIn just a day, the thread got over 370,000 likes and 75,000 retweets, with people saying that he\u2019s on a completely different level when it comes to style. Mr. Mwangi\u2019s meticulous attention to detail and passionate dedication to his style has swayed many on the internet.\n\u201cYou have to ask God for three things to be like who I am today: taste, choice, and wisdom,\u201d said James Maina Mwangi in a video showcasing his style.\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nyess werk\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nToy soldier. :D\nAfterwards, Mwangi got a break as he was elected as a youth coordinator and took care of youth projects that he launched: car washes, flowers and nursery planting, exhibitions, matatu transport routes management, rural electrification and many more. He created more than 6.4 millions youth jobs by the year 2006, leading to further success, and establishing his signature fashion more than 25 years ago.\n\u201cSome of my clothes were made by my tailor and the materials were imported. You won\u2019t find these in the general clothing stores. I have about 300 caps, 200 pairs of shoes, and 160 suits. Every week, I prepare 10 suits which I decided on the spot.\u201d\n\u201cI want the world to know that if you want to be blessed and be honest, serve your people and community. We need leaders with dignity who can deliver on their word, without leaving the youth without a choice. If they don\u2019t have one, they turn to robbery, drug dealing, trafficking, and whatnot.\u201d\nJames Maina Mwangi\nReport\nI love this guy.

But there are hurdles: the cost and repairs.\nBy Stephen Castle\nLONDON \u2014 When Britain leaves the European Union at the end of the month, it must secure trade ties to the Continent, revamp its migration rules and reset relations with global partners like the United States, to name just a few looming challenges.\nBut the question gripping Brexit supporters is whether the moment of departure will be marked by the familiar chimes of Big Ben.\nInconveniently, the country\u2019s most famous clock tower is under repair, like much of the crumbling parliamentary estate, yet that has not stopped a vigorous campaign to bring it back to life for a brief moment of history.\n\u201cBig Ben Must Bong For Brexit,\u201d screamed a front-page headline in the British tabloid The Daily Express, which was superimposed on a picture of the clock minus the scaffolding and cladding that conceal it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested that the 500,000-pound cost (about $650,000) of restoring the chimes for the night could be raised by crowd funding. But his office later conceded that there was no official way for the public to contribute.\n\u201cBoris\u2019 bonkers \u2018bung a bob for Big Ben Brexit bongs\u2019 bid bombs,\u201d was the verdict of another tabloid, The Daily Mirror, as frustrated Brexit enthusiasts hinted of a plot against them and suggested that church bells ring out instead.

For over 500 years, this Renaissance masterpiece has been keeping time in Piazza San Marco, offering both locals and tourists a spectacle of moving figures, astronomical precision and a bit of Venetian charm. The massive blue and gold clock face displays hours, minutes, moon phases and zodiac signs.\nOne of the tower's most famous features is its two bronze figures, the Moors, who strike the bell every hour. These statues, one older and one younger, symbolise time's passage\u2014past and future working together to keep Venice on schedule. Their mechanical movements have been fascinating onlookers for centuries, proving that even in a city built on water, time marches on.",

Those who choose to indulge now will learn a lot about the swashbuckling galactic cowboy Han Solo, made famous in the original films by Harrison Ford and here played in a younger version by Alden Ehrenreich. They will learn, for example, that Solo can be a dishonest card player when necessary, and that he met his first lover, Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke), while they were both living in the streets. Ron Howard directs an ensemble that also includes Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams in the originals) and Woody Harrelson as a mentor to Solo.

Directed by Director X and written by Alex Tse, it stars Trevor Jackson as a drug lord trying to complete a final job while surviving an assortment of enemies. Jason Mitchell, Michael K. Williams, Lex Scott Davis, and Jennifer Morrison also star. Rapper Future wrote original songs for the film, and produced alongside Joel Silver.\nSuperfly was released in the United States on June 13, 2018, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the style but ultimately found the film lacking substance. The movie was a box office disappointment, only grossing $20.8 million on a budget of $16\u201329 million.\nYoungblood Priest is a young cocaine kingpin from Atlanta, Georgia, working the streets since he was brought in by his mentor Scatter at age eleven. He lives with his two girlfriends, Georgia and Cynthia.\nJuju, a member of rival gang Snow Patrol, hits on Cynthia and, shooting at Priest, accidentally hits a bystander. The Snow Patrol members leave while Priest gives the victim money and directs them to the trauma center.\nPriest confides in his second-in-command Eddie that he wants out of drug-dealing, and has a plan. Eddie has his back but Scatter refuses to help. Juju suspects Priest of a hit on Snow Patrol and plans to retaliate. Snow Patrol deduces that Priest's colleague, Fat Freddie, was one of the assailants. Deciding to set Priest up, Eddie contacts two corrupt police officers to start their long plan to destroy Snow Patrol.\nFat Freddie is pulled over by corrupt cops Franklin and Mason. They discover cocaine and find Eddie in Freddie's contacts. With Mason's gun at Freddie's head, his girlfriend Rochelle reveals his criminal history and Priest's identity. Franklin shoots and kills them both.\nMason threatens to expose Priest's dealing if he does not work with her. Fighting over recriminations about Freddie's death, Priest starts strangling Eddie but leaves him unconscious. Franklin and Mason show up at Fat Freddie\u2019s funeral demanding their upfront payment of $1 million.\nThen Scatter surprises Priest there, ordering him to meet with his supplier Adalberto, after finding out he'd cut a secret deal for more product. Adalberto kills Scatter, having realized he had been stealing from him. He then threatens Priest, telling him that he can never get out of the game.\nSnow Patrol members led by Juju shoot up Priest's mansion. During the shootout, Cynthia shoots back but is killed, and Priest and Georgia set fire to the mansion. Juju runs through the fire and out of the mansion to get in a car chase with Priest, Georgia and now Q.\nChasing Priest, Juju is injured and Q is killed in car crashes. Eddie feigns allegiance with Snow Patrol, and tricks them into an ambush where they are killed by Mason and other cops alerted by Priest.\nPriest thanks Eddie for his help and prepares to leave the country with Georgia. He blackmails the mayor with a sex tape in exchange for a certain file of a convicted drug kingpin and promises he'll win in the upcoming election.\nAdalberto is disowned by his mother, when she obtains the file from Priest about her son setting up his other brother into prison and executed at her order after she discloses the proof that he framed his brother for a crime. As she walks away her men dispose of Adalberto's men who was also executed.Then instead of paying off Mason, Priest tips off the police and she is arrested for cocaine possession.\nPriest meets Franklin and beats him to a pulp to avenge Freddie's murder. Having settled his business obligations, and with his enemies either dead or in custody, Priest and Georgia relax on a cruise in Montenegro. When Georgia asks Priest how he feels, he replies, \"Free.\"\nProduction began in December 2017, with Future announcing the project and confirming Director X as director.[3] Principal photography started in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2018.[4] Filming wrapped in March 2018, a process that Deadline Hollywood called an \"unprecedented turnaround\".[5]\nWhile Sony and other publications reported the film was made on a net production budget of $16 million, Deadline stated their sources insisted the actual cost was \"well north of $20 [million], near $30 [million]\". The site compared the situation to Proud Mary, a film released in January 2018 that Sony reported cost $14 million to make but other sources listed at as high as $30 million.[1]\nThe soundtrack for the film was curated by American rapper Future, who also acted as a producer on the film. It features 13 new and previously released songs, as well as guest appearances from Miguel, Lil Wayne, Khalid, Ty Dolla Sign, Young Thug, PartyNextDoor, H.E.R., Gunna, Sleepy Brown, and Yung Bans, among others.[6]\nSuperfly was initially scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018. Three weeks prior, it was moved up two days to June 13, 2018, in order to avoid direct competition with Incredibles 2.[7]\nThe film was released on digital and iTunes on August 28, 2018 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It was released on Blu-Ray and DVD on 11 September 2018.[8]\nIn the United States and Canada, Superfly was projected to gross $7\u201312 million from 2,200 theaters over its five-day opening weekend.[5] The film made $1.2 million on its first day,[9] $938,583 on its second and $1.8 million on its third. It ended up grossing $6.9 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $9 million), finishing sixth at the box office.[1] It dropped to $3.4 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth, and after being pulled from 1,064 theaters in its third week made $1.3 million, finishing 12th.[10][11]\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 102 reviews, and an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Superfly updates the blaxploitation original with a stylish remake that's exciting and visually arresting enough to offer its own slickly staged action rewards, but disappointingly short on social subtext.\"[12] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[13] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 68% overall positive score.[1]\nVariety's Owen Gleiberman wrote: \"Shot in a functional, slammed-together manner that's less sensually stylish than you'd expect from a music-video auteur, the film is a competent yet glossy and hermetic street-hustle drug thriller, less a new urban myth than a lavishly concocted episode. It holds your attention yet leaves you with nothing.\"[14]\n\n### SuperFly (2018) - IMDb\nWith retirement on his mind, a successful Atlanta-based drug dealer sets up one last big job while dealing with trigger-happy colleagues and the police.\nYoungblood Priest: You ain't got shit. Literally. You're three months behind on your mortgage payments, and I don't care how many gangsters from Joyland you got with you. Ain't nobody more gangster than a bank.\n\u00a9 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.",

The dust around the point of insertion of the tooth inside the vertebra is also quite evocative of a forgery.\u201d\n\u201cIf a megalodon would have had bitten a whale, the tooth would not have entered the vertebra this way,\u201d Benoit said.\n\u201cAll in all, this look very much like a fake news to me.

No. 10 confirmed Mrs May would make a statement in Downing Street at 8.15pm earlier today after a series of meetings with opposition party leaders in Parliament. Being some 20 minutes late for her statement, the Prime Minister finally turned up and spoke directly to the British people through a televised speech.\nHere is what Theresa May said from Downing Street on Wednesday night:\"Nearly three years have passed since the public voted to leave the European Union.\n\"It was the biggest democratic exercise in our country's history.\n\"I came to office on a promise to deliver on that verdict.\n\"In March 2017 I triggered the Article 50 process for the UK to exit the EU and Parliament supported it overwhelmingly.\n\"Two years on, MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UK's withdrawal.\nREAD MORE:\u00a0May confesses 'GREAT PERSONAL REGRET' at Brexit delay but stands DEFIANT - 'Back my deal!'\n\"As a result, we will now not leave on time with a deal on the 29th of March.\n\"This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me.\n\"And of this I am absolutely sure: You, the public, have had enough.\n\"You're tired of the infighting, you're tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children's schools, our National Health Service, knife crime.\n\"You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side.\n\"It is now time for MPs to decide.\n\"So, today, I have written to Donald Tusk the President of the European Council to request a short extension of Article 50 up to the 30th of June to give MPs the time to make a final choice.\n\"Do they want to leave the EU with a deal which delivers on the result of the referendum, that takes control of our money borders and laws while protecting jobs and our national security?\n\"Do they want to leave without a deal, or do they not want to leave at all causing potentially irreparable damage to public trust not just in this generation of politicians but to our entire democratic process?\n\"It is high time we made a decision.\n\"So far, Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice.\n\"Motion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without Parliament ever deciding what it wants.\n\"All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want.\n\"I passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I've negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable.\n\"And I will continue to work night and day to secure the support of my colleagues, the DUP and others for this deal.\n\"But I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June.\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\"Some argue that I'm making the wrong choice and I should ask for a longer extension to the end of the year or beyond to give more time for politicians to argue over the way forward.\n\"That would mean asking you to vote in European elections nearly three years after our country decided to leave.\n\"What kind of message would that send? And just how bitter and divisive would that election campaign be at a time when the country desperately needs bringing back together.\n\"Some have suggested holding a second referendum.\n\"I don't believe that's what you want and it is not what I want.\n\"We asked you the question already and you've given us your answer.\n\"Now you want us to get on with it.\n\"And that is what I am determined to do.\"\nSEARCH\nCONNECT WITH US\nTODAY'S PAPER\nSee today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.\nEXPRESS.CO.UK\nDaily Express uses notifications to keep you updated\n\n### Timeline: Theresa May - three tumultuous Downing Street years\nWriting by Giles Elgood; editing by Stephen Addison\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n, opens new tab\nU.S. President Donald Trump might visit China before going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit between October 30 and November 1, or he could meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC event in South Korea, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday citing multiple sources.\nReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nOn 23 October 2018, a photograph was shared by Facebook user Michael Wyrick along with the claim that it pictured garbage left behind by the caravan of refugees traveling north toward the United States from Honduras:\nThe post reads:\nTrash being left behind by the migrant caravan.\nAs they move through an area, along with the path of destruction, they leave behind utter filth (poop, pee, food scraps, etc) There are plenty of sources for documentation. THEY MUST BE STOPPED!\nThis photograph was not recent and did not show refuse left behind by the caravan of refugees traveling from Honduras to the U.S>-Mexico border in October 2018.\nThis photograph, which first appeared online in September 2015, was reportedly taken by Polish blogger Kamil Bulonis near the border between of Austria and Germany and was frequently included in articles about an unruly (but unsubstantiated) encounter with Syrian refugees. (Local authorities later denied these reports.)\nA video report from the BBC confirmed that a group of refugees near the Austria-Germany border had left a large amount of garbage in their wake as they moved to a new location. The images drew online criticism not only from those opposed to the resettlement of these refugees, but also from fellow Syrians who urged their countrymen to clean up after themselves:\nAnd the below video was shot at the Hungarian-Austrian border where refugees and migrants boarding buses left behind tents and other items, hoping that they wouldn't need them any more. Unsurprisingly, the piles of rubbish have attracted hundreds of critical comments online, especially from Europeans concerned about refugee numbers. \"Scenes to shortly be replicated throughout Europe! God help us all,\" said one tweet, while another said: \"Garbage left on roads and creeks by refugees. This is how they treat their host countries.\" Thousands of tweets have mentioned the rubbish piles and pictures of the things left behind have been retweeted hundreds of times.\nBut the refugees and migrants are on social media too, and now it seems some are taking notice.

THEY MUST BE STOPPED!\nThis photograph was not recent and did not show refuse left behind by the caravan of refugees traveling from Honduras to the U.S>-Mexico border in October 2018.\nThis photograph, which first appeared online in September 2015, was reportedly taken by Polish blogger Kamil Bulonis near the border between of Austria and Germany and was frequently included in articles about an unruly (but unsubstantiated) encounter with Syrian refugees. (Local authorities later denied these reports.)\nA video report from the BBC confirmed that a group of refugees near the Austria-Germany border had left a large amount of garbage in their wake as they moved to a new location. The images drew online criticism not only from those opposed to the resettlement of these refugees, but also from fellow Syrians who urged their countrymen to clean up after themselves:\nAnd the below video was shot at the Hungarian-Austrian border where refugees and migrants boarding buses left behind tents and other items, hoping that they wouldn't need them any more. Unsurprisingly, the piles of rubbish have attracted hundreds of critical comments online, especially from Europeans concerned about refugee numbers. \"Scenes to shortly be replicated throughout Europe! God help us all,\" said one tweet, while another said: \"Garbage left on roads and creeks by refugees. This is how they treat their host countries.\" Thousands of tweets have mentioned the rubbish piles and pictures of the things left behind have been retweeted hundreds of times.\nBut the refugees and migrants are on social media too, and now it seems some are taking notice. In a Facebook group with more than 14,000 members, pictures and messages have been posted by refugees urging fellow travellers to clean up after themselves.\nOne of those posting photos is a man from Damascus, Ahmad Zoher. He fled to Egypt more than two years ago, and is still there.

The largest and best known of these were organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras (A People Without Borders) that set off during Holy Week in early 2017 and 2018 from the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA), but such caravans of migrants began arriving several years earlier, and other unrelated caravans continued to arrive into late 2018.\nThere is some disagreement as to whether the migrant caravans are primarily composed of refugees seeking asylum or are merely large concentrations of traditional economic migrants. Numerous human rights organizations document the increase in violence and abuse in recent years in Central American countries.[5][6][7][8] A report by the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development, cited by Amnesty International, noted that between 2007 and 2012, several Central American countries had the highest average annual female homicide rates in the world, although the average annual male homicide rates in the world are higher.[9][10] Other studies of the composition of the caravans indicated that the caravans more resemble traditional economic migrants.[11] The causes of the migration, as well as the proper way to settle or deport the migrants themselves, remains a source of political debate within the U.S.\nDrought and crop failure in the Central American dry corridor and climate change in Honduras have been factors in the formation of the caravans.[12][13][14][15][16] Honduras is one of the poorest and most violent countries in Central America. The country experienced a coup d'\u00e9tat in 2009 and is one of the most unequal countries in the world, while the poverty rate stood at 64.3% in 2018.\nAccording to the newspaper Le Monde, \"Caught between extreme poverty and ultra-violence, more and more Hondurans are choosing to flee their country, driven by the most extreme despair\". An opposition Honduran politician considers that migrants \"do not run after the American dream, they flee the Honduran nightmare\".[17]\nDiscussions of illegal immigration typically claim that there have been many caravans. Those that antedate 2017 were small affairs that did not move as a group to the U.S. border.\nThese \"Stations of the Cross\" migrant caravans have been held in southern Mexico for at least the last five years [2013\u20132018]. They began as short processions of migrants, some dressed in biblical garb and carrying crosses, as an Easter-season protest against the kidnappings, extortion, beatings and killings suffered by many Central American migrants as they cross Mexico. Individuals in the caravans often try to reach the U.S. border but usually not as part of the caravan. The caravans typically don't proceed much farther north than the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.[18]\nPueblo Sin Fronteras supported its first Holy Week caravan in 2017.[19]\nOn 25 March 2018, a group of about 700 migrants (80% from Honduras) began their way north from Tapachula.[20] By 1 April, the caravan had arrived in Mat\u00edas Romero, Oaxaca, and grown to about 1,200 people.[21] In mid-April, 500 migrants continued northward from Mexico City\u2014the caravan's last official stop\u2014toward Tijuana, in separate groups riding atop freight train cars.[22] Two busloads of the migrants arrived in Tijuana on 25 April and a further four busloads were making their way from Hermosillo.[23] On 29 April 2018, after traveling 2,500 miles (4,000\u00a0km) across Mexico, the migrants' caravan came to an end in Tijuana, at the Mexico\u2013United States border at Friendship Park.[24][25]\nMore than 150 migrants prepared to seek asylum from United States immigration officials.[26] United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the caravan \"a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system\".[26] On 30 April, Sessions' Justice Department announced criminal charges against eleven people for crossing the border illegally.[27]\nAmerican aid worker Scott Warren with the organization No More Deaths was arrested on 12 May on charges of illegally harboring people in the country, hours after releasing a report accusing the U.S. Border Patrol of tampering with water sources for migrants crossing the Arizona desert.[28] He pleaded not guilty and was ultimately acquitted in November 2019.[29][30]\nMigrants from Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador gathered on 12 October to meet at San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras. The caravan began the next day, intending to reach the United States to flee from violence, poverty, and political repression.[31][32] The caravan began with about 160 migrants but quickly gathered over 500 participants as it marched through Honduras.[33] Bartolo Fuentes, a former Honduran congressman and one of the march coordinators, stated that the goal of the caravan was to find safety in numbers as it traveled north.[34] Though he was at first convinced that the caravan was a spontaneous movement, Fuentes has since told several news agencies that the caravan was organized and popularized through a faked social media account bearing his own name and photograph, which has since been deleted from Facebook. Fuentes says he first heard about the fake account from Irineo Mujica of the organization Pueblo Sin Fronteras.[35] The same day it left, United States Vice President Mike Pence urged the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home.[36] Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez advised his citizens to return home and to \"not let yourselves be used for political purposes\".[37] Pueblo Sin Fronteras did not organize the October caravan, but expressed its solidarity with it. Irineo Mujico, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, did not himself recommend another caravan to the United States, instead advising its members to seek asylum in Mexico.[38]\nAs the caravan passed through the Guatemalan city of Chiquimula, Fuentes was arrested by police and deported.[39] Other Hondurans, traveling on buses, had their papers seized or were arrested, forcing migrants to travel on foot.[40] On entering Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n on 18 October 2018, the caravan numbered around 5,000, but began shrinking due to the speed of parts of the caravan and its reception in shelters in Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n.[41] The same day, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military and close the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to keep the caravan from entering the country.[42] Trump also threatened to cut aid to countries allowing the caravans to pass through.[43] Also on 18 October, Mexico flew two Boeing 727s transporting Federal Police officers to the Guatemala\u2013Mexico border.[44] The next day, 19 October, an estimated 4,000 migrants had gathered in Ciudad Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n in Guatemala. Mexican officials, including the ambassador to Guatemala, requested that migrants appear individually at the border for processing. The migrants ignored the request, and marched on the bridge, overwhelming Guatemalan police and Mexican barriers on the bridge, then entered Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, and encountered Federal Police in riot gear. After an hour-long standoff with police, whom migrants threw shoes and stones at, tear gas was used to push the migrants back onto the bridge. Officials reported that at least six Mexican police officers had been injured. After hostilities ended, migrants formed into lines and began processing by Mexican authorities. By the mid-afternoon, migrants were allowed entry in Mexico and were taken by bus to Tapachula. According to the Commissioner of the Federal Police, Manelich Castilla Craviotto, this was for processing and shelter. Migrants with valid visas and documentation were allowed immediate entrance, while asylum-seekers would be detained in a migration center for 45 days.[45]\nOn 20 October, about 2,000 migrants who had crossed the Suchiate River and entered Ciudad Hidalgo decided to rebuild the caravan to continue their trek to the United States.[46] The caravan again resumed its march early on 21 October from Tapachula.[46] A force of 700 Federal Police officers, mostly women, formed a human barricade on the Suchiate\u2013Tapachula highway, but withdrew as the 5,000-strong caravan of migrants came within 200 meters (660\u00a0ft). By the afternoon, the migrants reached Tapachula and its leaders decided to rest there, 40 kilometers (25\u00a0mi) inside Mexico.[47] Their march began again the next day, bound for Huixtla, another 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) away from Tapachula. Simultaneously, Guatemalan officials reported that another thousand migrants entered the country from Honduras, while another 1,000 migrants were reported making for Tapachula from Ciudad Hidalgo.[48]\nIrineo Mujica was arrested in Ciudad Hidalgo on 22 October while walking with a group of migrants to a church. Mujica was pulled out of a crowd of migrants by Mexican authorities and pushed into a white van. According to Pueblo Sin Fronteras, he was not involved in organizing the caravan and was conducting humanitarian work in Tapachula.[49] Mujica has since claimed that he and Pueblo Sin Fronteras were initially opposed to the timing of this migrant caravan, because they believed it would be used to build anti-immigration sentiment during the 2018 US midterm election.[35]\nAlso on 22 October, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would begin curtailing tens of millions of dollars in aid to three Central American nations, because they did not stop the caravan.[50][51] President Trump also threatened to send the U.S. military to close the border and stop the caravan.[52]\nOn 26 October, when the caravan was in the Arriaga Municipality of the state of Chiapas, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto unveiled his program entitled \"Est\u00e1s en tu casa\" (\"You are at home\").[53] This initiative allows caravan migrants meeting certain criteria to receive benefits and begin to normalize their immigration status in Mexico. Migrants who follow Mexican laws and are granted refugee status will, according to the plan, be entitled to temporary work permits and IDs, medical attention, housing in local establishments, and schooling for children.[54] In order to qualify, however, migrants must agree to settle in the states of Chiapas or Oaxaca and not continue to move north.[54]\nAs the second caravan entered Mexico on 30 October, the main body of some 4,000 migrants, at Santiago Niltepec, demanded \"safe and dignified\" transportation to Mexico City. Migrants still crossing into Mexico over the Suchiate river were dissuaded by Mexican helicopters and police.[55]\n\"The fact that the first of these caravans was able to move from Honduras into Guatemala and then into Mexico is inspiring other migrants to travel in large groups, reversing the long-established logic of Central American migration to the United States: Rather than trying to travel undetected, some migrants are trading invisibility for safety in numbers.\"\n- Kirk Semple and Elisabeth Malkin for The New York Times, 31 October 2018[56] \"...at least 100 were \"kidnapped\" (exhausted walkers were lured into vehicles) in the state of Puebla and allegedly handed over to the Zetas gang...\"[57]\nSome scientists contend that the impact of climate change is causing crop failures and exacerbating poverty in Central America, thereby creating what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has called \"climate refugees.\"[58] According to Robert Albro, a researcher at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, \"The main reason people are moving is because they don't have anything to eat. This has a strong link to climate change \u2013 we are seeing tremendous climate instability that is radically changing food security in the region.\"[59]\nA week before the 2018 midterm elections, the US Government sent 5,200 active-duty soldiers to the US-Mexico border to \"harden\" it further. 2,100 National Guard troops were already present.[95]\nOn November 23, mayor of Tijuana Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum declared a \"humanitarian crisis\" in response to the large number of migrants in the city.[96] By this date, over 5,000 members of the caravan were staying at the Tijuana Stadium\u2014 a structure with a capacity of 3,000.[97]\nOn November 25, a group of approximately 500 migrants marched to the San Ysidro Port of Entry to demand answers. Frustrated by the slow pace of asylum application processing (approximately 60 per day) and the dire living conditions in their tent cities, they attempted to bypass the Mexican Federal Police to reach the border wall when a commotion occurred.[98] A member of the caravan was caught on video throwing rocks at border agents while at the border wall. In response, the United States Border Patrol launched tear gas over the border at the group, which included women and children, and subsequently shut down the crossing for six hours.[99] Photographs of the incident received significant media attention and sparked extensive international commentary. 42 migrants were arrested, and a total of 4 Border agents were struck by rocks.[100]\nIn the United States, the migrant caravan was a major issue for President Donald Trump and other Republicans and conservatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Immigrant invasion rhetoric and George Soros conspiracy theories were used by conservative commentators on Fox News. The caravan was described as an \"invading horde\" by Laura Ingraham, an \"invasion\" by Steve Doocy, \"a full-scale invasion by a hostile force\" by Michelle Malkin,[101] \"a criminal involvement on the part of these leftist mobs\" and \"a highly organized, very elaborate sophisticated operation\" by Chris Farrell.[102] According to closed captioning transcripts, the word \"invasion\" was used in relation to the caravan more than 60 times on Fox News in October 2018 and more than 75 times on Fox Business.[103] Commentators noted that mentions of the caravan by Fox News dropped dramatically immediately following the 2018 midterm elections.[104][105][106]\nDisinformation was promoted by Trump and supporters including the claim that there were \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners\" in the caravan, despite the lack of any publicized evidence for this charge.[107] Likewise, Vice President Pence in an interview with Fox News stated:\nWhat the president of Honduras told me is that the caravan was organized by leftist organizations, political activists within Honduras, and he said it was being funded by outside groups, and even from Venezuela ... So the American people, I think, see through this\u2014they understand this is not a spontaneous caravan of vulnerable people.[108]\nThe president of Honduras at the time, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, was a member of the right-wing National party[109] and an opponent of the Venezuelan government led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.[110]\nThe Twitter account of the Department of Homeland Security \"confirmed\" that within the caravan there were people who are \"gang members or have significant criminal histories,\" but did not offer any evidence of ties. NRATV alleged that \"a bevy of left-wing groups\" were working with George Soros and the Venezuelan government \"to try to influence the 2018 midterms by sending Honduran migrants north in the thousands\".[107]\nOn November 2, 2018, five days before the election, the Department of Homeland Security website issued a press release, \"Myth vs. Fact: Caravan\", stating that \"over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership\". It cited no sources for the specific numbers and crimes claimed, but did cite Mexican officials to back up their claim that the caravan contained criminal groups.[111] The DHS also claimed the caravan contained migrants from Afghanistan, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, though they didn't cite any sources.[111]\nOne study by the National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE) at the University of Southern California and the Institute for Defense Analyses stated that the Central American immigrants traveling to the U.S. and claiming asylum had more in common with economic migrants than traditional refugees.[11] Both groups receive funding or sponsorship from the US government.[112][113]\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said: \"Obviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it's legal.\"[114]\nInitially positive, the Mexican public's sentiment soured rapidly. El Universal's October 2018 survey found that 64.5% of the Mexican public believed that Central American migrants increased violence or unemployment; this figure increased to 73% in the following month's survey. 56% of the public believed that L\u00f3pez Obrador needs to be \"tougher\" on future migrants.[115]\nThe 2019 survey found that 58% of Mexican respondents oppose migration from Central America.[116]\nAs the United States prepared for elections in 2020 unknown groups promoted messages on social media sites for another caravan.[117]\nIn October 2020, migrant caravans from Honduras were either intercepted by Guatemalan Army officers and deported back to Honduras upon reaching the border crossings, or evaded border restrictions and reached Guatemala City, with intent to continue their journey to Mexico. The Mexican military and border police have repeatedly warned that no migrant caravans will be allowed to cross into Mexico.\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, there was a resurgence in migrant caravan activities. Fox News claimed this to be related to Biden's planned amnesty for undocumented immigrants within his first 100 days in office.[118]\nOn January 13, just one week prior to the Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, more than 3,000 people departed Honduras and El Salvador for the United States. That number grew to approximately 7,000-8,000 one week later.[119]\nOn January 16, Guatemala and Mexico deployed the military to their borders, in an attempt to stop the migrant caravan from transiting through their countries on the way to the United States.[120][121] Three days later, the migrant caravans reportedly dissolved in the Guatemalan-Honduran border region, and most its participants were deported back to Honduras.[122][123]\nFrom June 2022, up to 15,000 migrants, mostly from Central America and Venezuela, set out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula in a caravan bound to the United States. [124][125] On 5 July, a caravan of almost 7,000 people departed from Tapachula. They broke up in Huixtla after two days.[126]\nOn 11 December 2022, a migrant caravan of over 1,000 people crossed illegally into El Paso from Ciudad Juarez.[127]\nIn April and May 2023, caravans of between 2,000 and 3,000 people departed from Tapachula.[128] In October, another caravan of 4,000 people departed from Tapachula.[129]\nIn December 2023, a migrant caravan called \"Exodus for Poverty\" totaled between 8,000 and 10,000 arrived in the Mexican state of Chiapas. In January 2024, nearly 2,000 migrants arrived in Oaxaca.[130]",

The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.\nFacebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.\nSpecifically, the posts claim that the artwork \u2014 depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries \u2014 was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.\n\u201cThe Denver airport mural painted in 1994,\u201d the posts read. \u201cTell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\u201d\nBut the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport\u2019s public art available on the airport\u2019s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is \u201cnot from DEN\u2019s art collection.\u201d The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.\nThere is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It\u2019s called \u201cChildren of the World Dream of Peace,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)\nAs for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.\nIn late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting \u2014 posted by Trinidad days earlier \u2014 on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece \u201cMaskcommunication.\u201d\nTrinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.\nBut the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.\nIt was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, \u201cUnited Against Corona- Express through Art,\u201d by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.\nThe competition website lists the \u201c[d]ate of submission\u201d as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020.\nThe photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February \u2014 though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.\nIn the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not\u00a0show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name \u201cNEHA\u201d appears in the top left corner of the painting.\nWe reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting \u2014 and we\u2019ll update this story if we hear back.\nEither way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 \u2014 and it\u2019s false to say that it\u2019s a mural in the Denver airport.\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Those staffing cuts did not cause the high number of deaths in the flash floods on July 4, experts said. Local forecasting offices were sufficiently staffed and issued timely warnings. But experts raised concerns about key positions being vacant, which could have affected coordination with local communities.",

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\"This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Y\u2019all See Anything Like This, Don\u2019t Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Don\u2019t Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving....!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \"lying in the road\" method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \"lying-in-the-road\" ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \"state police\" found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \"has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\" A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \"No such incident took place in Tampa.\" The spokesperson added, \"We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \"No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\"\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\"Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts ... Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\"\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\nIt's not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\nIt's also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it's not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"False.\"\nDan Mac Guill is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### This photo was taken in 2019, not during the Covid-19 \u2026\nChoose language\nCopyright \u00a9 AFP 2017-2025.

All of it is technologically simple | Sources: misinformation moves top-down as well as bottom-up | Claims: much misinformation concerns the actions of public authorities | Responses: platforms have responded to much, but not all, of the misinformation identified by fact-checkers\u00a0| Conclusions and recommendations | Footnotes | References\u00a0| Acknowledgements | About the authors | Methodological Appendix\nIn this factsheet we identify some of the main types, sources, and claims of COVID-19 misinformation seen so far. We analyse a sample of 225 pieces of misinformation rated false or misleading by fact-checkers and published in English between January and the end of March 2020, drawn from a collection of fact-checks maintained by First Draft.\nWe find that:\nIn mid-February, the World Health Organization announced that the new coronavirus pandemic was accompanied by an \u2018infodemic\u2019 of misinformation (WHO 2020).\nMis- and disinformation1 about science, technology, and health is neither new nor unique to COVID-19. Amid an unprecedented global health crisis, many journalists, policy makers, and academics have echoed the WHO and stressed that misinformation about the pandemic presents a serious risk to public health and public action.\nCristina Tard\u00e1guila, Associate Director of the International Fact-checking Network (IFCN), has called COVID\u201319 \u2018the biggest challenge fact-checkers have ever faced.\u2019 News media are covering the pandemic and responses to it intensively and platform companies have tightened their community standards and responded in other ways. Some governments, including in the UK, have set up various government units to counter potentially harmful content.\nThis factsheet uses a sample of fact-checks to identify some of the main types, sources, and claims of COVID-19 misinformation seen so far. Building on other analyses (Hollowood and Mostrous 2020; EuVsDIS 2020; Scott 2020), we combine a systematic content analysis of fact-checked claims about the virus and the pandemic with social media data indicating the scale and scope of engagement.\nThe 225 pieces of misinformation analysed were sampled from a corpus of English-language fact-checks gathered\u00a0by First Draft, focusing on content rated false or misleading. The corpus combines articles to the end of March from fact-checking contributors to two\u00a0separate networks: the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and Google Fact Checking Tools. We systematically assessed each fact-checked instance and coded it for the type of misinformation, the source for it, the specific claims it contained, and what seemed to be the motivation behind it. Furthermore, we gathered social media engagement data for all pieces of content identified and linked to by fact-checkers in the sample to get an indication of the relative reach of and engagement with different false or misleading claims. A majority (88%) of the sample appeared on social media platforms. A small amount (also) appeared on TV (9%), was published by news outlets (8%), or appeared on other websites (7%). Throughout the factsheet, when we speak about misinformation, it is on the basis of this sample of content rated false or misleading by independent professional fact- checkers. Please see the methodological appendix for a fuller description of the methods and sample.\nWhile fact-checks provide a reliable way to identify timely pieces of misinformation, fact-checkers cannot address every piece of misinformation and their professional work necessarily involves various selection biases as they focus scare resources (Graves 2016). Fact-checkers also have limited access to misinformation spreading in private channels, by email, in closed groups, and via messaging apps (and in offline conversations). Similarly, engagement data for social media posts analysed here is only indicative of wider engagement with and exposure to misinformation which can spread in many different ways, both online and offline. In many cases, it is likely that claims were repeated and spread by many accounts across platforms not included in these data. Still, engagement data provide some indication of the relative reach of different claims.\nThus, the analysis is neither comprehensive (we do not systematically examine misinformation in search, via photo-sharing platforms and messaging applications, or sites like Reddit, or for that matter via news media or government communications), nor is it exhaustive (we look only at a sample of English-language fact-checks). We still believe it takes a step towards better understanding the scale and scope of the problems we face.\nBelow, we present five findings that describe the makeup and circulation of misinformation about COVID-19 based on our content analysis, finalised by 31 March.\nIn response to growth in the volume and diversity of misinformation in circulation, the number of fact-checks concerning COVID-19 has increased dramatically over the last three months (see Figure 1). Many fact-checking outlets around the world appear to be devoting much \u2013 if not most \u2013 of their time and resources to debunking claims about the pandemic. Even so, that fact-checking organisations continue to find new claims to investigate speaks to the large amount of misinformation circulating.\nRather than being completely fabricated, much of the misinformation in our sample involves various forms of reconfiguration where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked (see Figure 2) (Wardle 2019). Judging from the social media data collected, reconfigured content saw higher engagement than content that was wholly fabricated.2 Our analysis recognised three different sub-types of misinformation that reconfigured existing information. The most common form of misinformation, \u2018misleading content\u2019 (29%), contained some true information, but the details were reformulated, selected, and re-contextualised in ways that made them false or misleading. One very widely shared post offered medical advice from someone\u2019s uncle, combining both accurate and inaccurate information about how to treat and prevent the spread of the virus. While some of the advice, such as washing one\u2019s hands, aligns with the medical consensus, other suggestions do not. For example, the piece claims: \u2018This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the sun.\u2019 While heat will kill the virus, 27 degrees Celsius is not high enough to do so.\nA second common form of misinformation involves images or videos labelled or described as being something other than they are (24%). For example, one post shows a picture of a selection of vegan foods untouched on an otherwise empty grocery shelf and suggests that \u2018Even with the Corona Virus (sic) panic buying, no one wants to eat Vegan food.\u2019 AFP Australia observed this image is of a grocery store shelf in Texas in 2017, ahead of Hurricane Harvey. This is also an example of what some call \u2018malinformation\u2019 (Wardle 2019).\nOur sample includes a small number of manipulated images and videos. Every example of doctored or manipulated content in this sample employed simple, low-tech photo or video editing techniques. One video includes images of bananas edited into a news segment to suggest that bananas can prevent or cure COVID-19.\nDespite a great deal of recent concern, we saw no examples of misinformation employing deep fakes or other AI-based tools. Rather, manipulated content are \u2018cheap fakes\u2019 (Paris and Donovan 2019) produced using techniques that have existed as long as there have been photographs and film.\nHigh-level politicians, celebrities, or\u00a0other prominent public figures produced or spread only 20% of the misinformation in our sample, but that misinformation attracted a large majority of\u00a0all social media engagements in the sample. While some of these instances involve content posted on social media, 36% of top-down misinformation also includes politicians speaking publicly or to the media. As an example, the New York Times and others have documented that President Donald Trump has made a number of false statements on the topic at events, on Fox News, and on Twitter. While our data do not capture the reach of misinformation spread via TV, top-down misinformation on social media accounted for 69% of total social media engagements in our sample3 (see Figure 3), driven in part by very high levels of engagement with misinformation posted or spread by high-level elected officials, celebrities, and other prominent public figures (including a US-based technology entrepreneur).\nDespite this, it is important not to underestimate the amount (or influence) of bottom-up misinformation produced and spread by members of the broader public. Not only did this content make up the vast majority of our sample in terms of volume, some individual pieces, such as one about saunas and hair dryers preventing COVID-19, also occasionally generated large volumes of engagement. It is difficult to assess motivation from content alone as members of the public often engage in highly ambiguous practices online (Philips and Milner 2017). Members of the public appear to have many reasons for sharing pieces of misinformation, including a desire to \u2018troll\u2019, the legitimate belief information is true, and political partisanship.\nIt is also notable how few pieces of misinformation across the sample appeared intended to generate a profit. Only six (3%) pieces of content were obviously linked to supposed cures, vaccines, or protective equipment for sale, and eight (4%) were posted on advertising-heavy websites and meant to generate clicks.4 (This may reflect the priorities of professional fact-checkers rather than the wider universe of misinformation, as\u00a0there is almost certainly a large volume of low-grade for-profit coronavirus misinformation being published by those trying to generate advertising revenues that may evade the attention of fact-checkers).\nAcross the sample, the most common claims within pieces of misinformation concern the actions or policies that public authorities are taking to address COVID-19, whether individual national/regional/local governments, health authorities, or international bodies like the WHO and UN (see Figure 4). The second most common type of claim concerns the spread of the virus through communities. This ranged from claims that geographic areas had seen their first infections, to content blaming certain ethnic groups for spreading the virus.\nNotably, misinformation about government action and about the public spread of the virus generally challenge information often communicated by various public authorities: whether that is communicating their direct policies or providing pressing public information. While the prominence of these topics may be a function of being easier for fact-checkers to validate, they could also indicate that governments have not always succeeded in providing clear, useful, and trusted information to address pressing public questions. In the absence of sufficient information, misinformation about these topics may fill in gaps in public understanding, and those distrustful of their government or political elites may be disinclined to trust official communications on these matters.\nSeveral of the major social media platform companies have taken steps to try to limit the spread of misinformation about COVID-19. While policies vary, some platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, say they have begun to remove fact-checked false and potentially harmful posts with reference to community standards that have in several cases been tightened in response to the pandemic. Facebook also now in some cases includes warning labels on content that has been rated false by independent fact- checkers.\nSocial media platforms have responded to a majority of the social media posts rated false in our sample. There is nonetheless very significant variation from company to company (see Figure 5). While 59% of false posts remain active on Twitter with no direct warning label, the number is 27% for YouTube and 24% for Facebook. Please also note that each false claim may exist in many slightly different permutations on any given platform, and our analysis only captures if the platform in question has acted against the first or main piece identified as false by fact-checkers.\nThere is no directly\u00a0comparable data available,\u00a0but background conversations with fact-checkers suggest COVID-19-related misinformation is more likely to be actioned by platforms than, for example, political misinformation. If this is so, it may reflect\u00a0the combination of the clear and present danger of the pandemic, less partisan disagreement, and the fact that there is expertise and evidence to determine more clearly what is false and what is not than is the case in many political discussions (Vraga and Bode 2020).\nOur analysis suggests that misinformation about COVID-19 comes in many different forms, from many different sources, and makes many different claims. It frequently reconfigures existing or true content rather than fabricating it wholesale, and where it is manipulated, is edited with simple tools.\nGiven the scope and seriousness of the pandemic, independent media and fact-checkers and actions by platforms and others play an important role in addressing virus-related misinformation. Fact-checkers can help sort false from true material, and accurate from misleading claims. Our finding that much misinformation directly or indirectly questions the actions, competence, or legitimacy of public authorities (including governments, health authorities, and international organisations) suggests it will be difficult for those institutions to address or correct it directly without running into multiple problems. How many people will accept as credible a government trying to debunk or refute misinformation that casts that very same government in a negative light? In contrast, independent fact-checkers can provide authoritative analysis of misinformation while helping platforms identify misleading and problematic content, just as independent news media can report credibly on how governments and others are responding (with varying degrees of success) to the pandemic.\nOur analysis also found that prominent public figures continue to play an outsized role in spreading misinformation about COVID-19. While only a small percentage of the individual pieces of misinformation in our sample come from prominent politicians, celebrities, and other public figures, these claims often have very high levels of engagement on various social media platforms. The growing willingness of some news media to call out falsehoods and lies from prominent politicians can perhaps help counter this (though it risks alienating their strongest supporters.) Similarly, the decision by Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in late March to remove posts shared by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro because they included coronavirus misinformation was in our view an important moment in how platform companies handle the problem that a lot of misinformation comes from the top.\nAlthough our data do not capture it, misinformation from prominent public figures can also spread widely through other channels such as TV. While fact-checks rarely spread either as widely or in the same networks (Bounegru et al. 2017) as the misinformation it corrects, it is imperative that trusted fact-checking and media organisations continue to hold prominent figures to account for claims they make across all channels and find new ways to distribute and publicise their work.\nThat being said, fact-checking is a scarce resource. Our findings demonstrate the degree to which fact checking organisations have redeployed their limited resources to address misinformation surrounding COVID-19. It is important that fact-checkers continue to increase coordination to limit overlap in the claims they assess and validate. At the same time, the pressing imperative to validate coronavirus information does not also mean that misinformation about other topics has become less prominent or important. Given some initial indication that news about COVID-19 is supplementing rather than replacing existing news use, there is reason to suspect there remains a diverse landscape\u00a0of misinformation circulating globally. It remains unclear what effect this\u00a0rapid shifting of fact-checking resources and attention will have on the larger information environment. Given the importance of independent fact-checkers, we can only hope that more funders will be willing to support such work going forward.\nWhile describing the landscape of COVID-19 misinformation as an \u2018infodemic\u2019 captures the scale, our analysis suggests it risks mischaracterising the nature of the problems we face. As we have shown, there is wide variety in the types of misinformation circulating, the claims made concerning the virus, and motivations behind its production. Unlike the pandemic itself, there is no single root cause behind the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus. Instead, COVID-19 appears to be supplying the opportunity for very different actors with a range of different motivations and goals to produce a variety of types of misinformation about many different topics. In this sense, misinformation about COVID-19 is as diverse as information about it.\nThe risk in not recognising the diversity in the landscape of coronavirus misinformation is assuming there could be a single solution to this set of problems. Instead, our findings suggest there will be no silver bullet or inoculation \u2013 no \u2018cure\u2019 for misinformation about the new coronavirus. Instead, addressing the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 will take a sustained and coordinated effort by independent fact-checkers, independent news media, platform companies, and public authorities to help the public understand and navigate the pandemic.\n1\u00a0Many define disinformation as knowingly false content meant to deceive. Given the difficulty in knowing or assessing this, we use the term misinformation throughout this factsheet to refer broadly to any type of false information \u2013 including disinformation.\n2\u00a0\u00a0An independent samples t-test showed a significant difference in engagement between reconfigured and fabricated content t(137)=1.241, p < 0.05.\u00a0\n3\u00a0\u00a0As discussed in the appendix, we were able to find engagement data for only 145 articles. Top-down claims constituted 15% of this reduced sample.\u00a0\n4\u00a0\u00a0Beyond the issues discussed here it is worth recognising that some governments globally are arguably withholding public interest information about the pandemic and in some cases actively misinforming the public about the health situation and the actions taken to address it.\nWe would like to thank Claire Wardle, Carlotta Dotto and Pedro Noel\u00a0at First Draft for sharing their corpus of fact-checks.

Fact- checks were sampled from a corpus of 2,871 articles provided to the authors by First Draft that consolidates virus-related fact-checks from the Poynter\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) database and Google\u2019s Fact Check Explorer tool between January and March 2020.\nAfter excluding all non-English\u00a0entries, a sample of 18% of articles was drawn at random from the remaining corpus (N=1253) and a secondary sample of an additional 20% was drawn at random. Duplicate articles and those that had a \u2018true\u2019 rating in the primary sample were replaced from the secondary sample. Importantly, no articles from 31 March 2020 were included in the corpus. The % increase in fact-checks between March and January quoted in the factsheet may be slightly under-estimated.\nFalse claims circulating in messaging apps and private groups on social media platforms are likely to be underrepresented in international fact-checks. Similarly, fact-checkers must make choices of how to use limited time and resources. Many of the fact-checking organisations in this corpus have an agreement with Facebook in which they regularly complete fact-checks of Facebook content. While there is no guarantee that fact-checkers assess a representative sample of misinformation, this sample provides a means of understanding in general the types of misinformation in circulation and some of the most common false claims made about COVID-19. Similarly, owing to the individual styles and\u00a0approaches of the many fact-checking organisations included in this sample, the fact-checks analysed here differ in terms of format and detail, ranging from in-depth descriptions that included links and screenshots to those providing only very basic information about the piece of misinformation in question. As a result, it was not always possible to determine certain variables.\nArticles were analysed by two coders based on a pre- defined coding scheme. The coding scheme included a series of descriptive variables (see full codebook below), as well as measures of misinformation type, apparent motive, and types of claims within pieces of misinformation. The typology for types of misinformation was adapted from Wardle\u2019s (2019) popular 7-part typology. The measure of apparent\u00a0motivation adapted Wardle\u2019s 8-part typology into six motivations (poor journalism, parody/satire, trolling or true belief, politics, profit, other) (Wardle, 2017).\nThe typology of claims within misinformation was inductively produced to be specific to misinformation about COVID-19. A rough typology was generated based on existing scholarship on health misinformation\u00a0and an initial review of COVID-19 claims. Next, both reviewers coded the same 10 pieces of misinformation identified through AFP fact-checks, discussed the coding, and refined the typology. See Table 1 for the final inductively generated typology with descriptions. In coding this variable, coders selected all claims that appeared in a piece of content.\n10% of entries were coded by both coders\u00a0to assess intercoder reliability. Cohen\u2019s kappa for misinformation type (0.82) and misinformation claims (0.88) were acceptable. Cohen\u2019s kappa for apparent motivation (0.68) was marginal and reflects the difficulty assessing motivation from content alone. Findings reported have reflected this difficulty.\nCoders also assessed if the original misinformation claim was produced or spread by high level politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures (top- down) or by members of the general public (bottom- up).\nGiven the well-publicised effort by social media platforms to address COVID-19 related misinformation, coders recorded if debunked content from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube had been labelled as \u2018false\u2019, removed (by platform or submitter), or remained active on the platform. Rather than count every repeated posting on a platform, coders recorded the status of the first or main piece identified for each platform for a given fact-check. All coded instances of active posts without warning labels were re-checked at the end of March. It is possible that posts included in this corpus have been removed or labelled since then. Please also note that each false claim may exist in many slightly different permutations on any given platform, and our analysis only captures if the platform in question has acted against the first or main piece identified as false by fact-checkers.\nCoders also gathered engagement metrics (likes, comments and shares) for all pieces of misinformation linked or archived by fact-checks. Recorded likes, comments, and shares were summed into a single engagement metric. Views were not included in the total engagement metric. It should be noted that some social platforms actively down-rank posts once they have been flagged by fact-checkers. By basing engagement scores on archived/screenshotted posts, these data are indicative of a post\u2019s popularity before being flagged. Even so, this engagement score likely underestimates the true engagement for a misinformation claim, which is often repeated and spread by many separate accounts. Of the 225 fact- checks in the sample engagement data were found for 145.\nWe use cookies and process personal data for the following purposes: Functional, Embedded external content & Analytics.",

This video has been shared with a variety of claims. In some postings, this anaconda is listed as 50 feet long. In others, it's labeled as a more reasonable 10 meters (about 32 feet long):\nThis video has been severely distorted to make this snake appear much larger. While we can't say for certain just how big this snake really was, we can say that the snake appears much smaller than 10 meters long in the unedited version of this video.\nThe unedited version of this viral video has been circulating online since at least April 2018.

There are many reasons for this. Here are some of them:\nWe often come across videos that look bent or twisted. This can be quite worrying when we need the video to preserve important memories of our loved ones. There are many types of video distortion that can happen.\nTo clarify distorted video footage, we can utilize various techniques such as using video editing software for color correction, applying filters or effects to enhance clarity, and adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation. Below we will look at a number of simple video enhancement techniques that you can easily apply to your video footage.\nWe can use video editing software to fix color in blurry videos. Here is how we do it:\nTo enhance clarity in distorted video footage, we can apply filters or effects.

Aerial TV footage showed a front side of the passenger train ripped open. Photos showed crates of beer on the freight train and a tarpaulin on top torn in pieces.\nJesper Nielsen told Denmark\u2019s TV2 he was riding on the passenger train and it \u201cwas out on the bridge when there was a huge \u2018bang\u2019 ... very quickly thereafter, the train braked.\u201d\nThe rail operator, Danish Railways, told Denmark\u2019s TV2 the victims were passengers on a train going from the city of Odense, on the central Danish island of Funen, to the capital of Copenhagen when the accident took place about 8 a.m.\nPolice declined to comment directly on a report from Denmark\u2019s TV2 channel that a large freight container had likely fallen off the cargo train.\n\u201cIt is much too early to speculate as to what might have caused it,\u201d chief police investigator Joergen Andersen told reporters. \u201cIt has been a pretty serious accident.\u201d\nThe accident, in which 16 people were injured, took place on a road-and-rail bridge, part of the Storebaelt system of bridges and a tunnel that link the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. The system was closed to cars overnight because of strong winds but trains were allowed to continue using it.\nPolice spokesman Lars Braemhoej said one possible cause of the \u201cconsiderable damage\u201d on the passenger train was getting struck by cargo from the freight train, but noted that authorities \u201cdo not know precisely what caused the accident.\u201d\nKasper Elbjoern, spokesman for the Danish brewery group Carlsberg, confirmed that a freight train transporting its cargo was involved in the accident.\nPolice urged passengers to contact relatives and tell them if they were safe and urged people not to share photos or videos of the accident.\nFlemming Jensen, the CEO of state-owned Danish Railways, said police and the Danish Accident Investigation Board were investigating. He said the operator \u201cwill contribute everything that we can to the investigation.\u201d\nBo Haaning of the Danish Accident Investigation Board was quoted as saying it could take months before the cause of the accident could be determined.\nThe government agency responsible for Danish railways said on Twitter that no further trains would cross the Storebaelt link on Wednesday, adding it was aiming to allow train crossings to resume Thursday. Road traffic resumed Wednesday with a 50 kph (31 mph) speed limit.\n\u201cOrdinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\u201d Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said as he issued his condolences.\nDenmark\u2019s Queen Margrethe said the \u201cterrible accident ... touches me deeply.\u201d\nIn 1988, eight people were killed and 72 injured when a train derailed because of high speed near Soroe, west of Copenhagen.\nDenmark\u2019s worst train accident occurred in 1919, when an express train collided with a stopped train in Copenhagen due to a dispatcher error. A total of 40 people were killed and some 60 were injured.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that the English spelling of the island is Funen.\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But it was unclear just what happened, or how people died.\nThe deputy manager of Denmark\u2019s Accident Investigation Board, Bo Haaning, told reporters at the scene that a cargo container carried by the freight train had somehow struck the passenger train. He said the trailer, which was apparently empty, had overturned or had been blown off the freight train.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\nSee subscription options\nMake sense of the day\u2019s news and ideas.\nCatch up on big news, and wind down to end your day.\nThe biggest stories of our time, in 20 minutes a day.\nGet what you need to know to start your day.\nOriginal analysis on the week\u2019s biggest global stories.\nThe latest news for any part of the world you select.\nBackstories and analysis from our Canadian correspondents.\nThe most crucial business and policy news you need to know.\nOur best tech reporting from the week.\nOur tech journalists help you make sense of the rapidly changing tech world.\nReviews, news and features to help you find your next read.\nStreaming TV and movie recommendations.\nThe podcast that takes you inside the literary world.\nPop music news, new songs and albums, and artists of note.\nUnwind with stories about culture and the way we live.\nEssential news and guidance to live your healthiest life.\nThe complicated love lives of real people.\nMapping the new world order through interviews and conversations.\nYou've heard the news, here's what to make of it.\nDiscussions of ideas that matter, plus book recommendations.\nPodcasts and narrated articles covering news, tech, culture and more.Go to Audio\nCome on in, the culture's fine.\nYour morning listen.

The accident took place on one of the bridges in the Storebaelt system, also known as the Great Belt link.\nEmergency crews work at the site of a train accident that killed at least six people Wednesday in Nyborg, Denmark. The accident took place on one of the bridges in the Storebaelt system, also known as the Great Belt link.\nAt least six people were killed and 16 more wounded Wednesday in an accident that happened as a passenger train was crossing a long bridge between two islands in central Denmark. Citing police, Danish media say the train was hit by something that fell off a passing freight train.\nThe accident happened around 7:30 a.m. on the busy Storebaelt bridge and tunnel system that connects the central islands of Zealand and Funen, according to the Danish Broadcasting Corp.\nFunen police say all of the 16 people who were injured are expected to recover, the Danish broadcaster reports. The trains passed each other at a site near Nyborg, roughly 75 miles west of Copenhagen.\n\"Ordinary Danes on their way to work or heading home from the Christmas holidays have had their lives smashed,\" Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in a statement of sympathy as translated by The Associated Press.\nPolice say they're still trying to learn more details about what happened. Danish media report that an object from the freight train may have forced the passenger train to stop suddenly. The item that fell from the freight train has variously been reported as a piece of cargo or a tarpaulin.\nImages from the scene showed heavy damage to the passenger train, including a partially caved-in nose. Windows were shattered, and debris littered the tracks. The freight train, which was carrying a load that included crates of Carlsberg beer, was also damaged. Photos showed that several long tarpaulins covering the train's cargo trailers had been ripped apart.\nEmergency crews at the scene have been hampered by high winds, and even after the adjacent roadway was reopened, a high-wind advisory kept high-profile vehicles off the bridge. Police also asked drivers to move through the area of the crash at a steady pace \u2014 and not slow down to stare or take photos of the accident scene.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor\nThese cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the NPR Services and to enable you to use some of their features.

Alongside the shelling, which caused widespread damage, Indian forces in Kashmir killed two suspected militants during a night-time clash. It comes after Pakistani and Indian fighter jets staged tit-for-tat cross-border raids this week.\nShelling that has been a part of daily life for decades has intensified even as Pakistan freed a pilot shot down on its side of the Line of Control. \"There is a very high risk of escalation towards localised, but more intense direct Indian-Pakistani military confrontation in Kashmir,\" Jane\u2019s Intelligence service said in a study this week. Heavy mortar and artillery fire sent inhabitants on both sides of the LoC scurrying for bunkers and other cover.\nOne woman was killed and an Indian soldier wounded during shelling late Thursday and early Friday in the Poonch and Krishna Ghati sectors on the Indian side, police claimed. Indian authorities told villages to turn off lights to avoid becoming a target for Pakistani gunners. Nowshera, a small town three kilometres from the ceasefire line, was plunged into darkness but gunfire and explosions broke the silence through the night.\nSurjeet Kumar, village head in the town\u00b4s Kalal sector, told how he was at home with his family when the building was hit by nine 120mm mortars.

The women had come from Andhra Pradesh to offer their prayers, even as confusion over the Supreme Court verdict on allowing entry to women of menstruating ages continued.\n#SabarimalaTemple: Police has sent back 10 women from Pamba. The women (between the age of 10 to 50) had come from Andhra Pradesh to offer prayers at the temple. The temple is schedule to open today in the evening for the Mandala Pooja festival. #Kerala pic.twitter.com/YM17JC5Ogp\nDevotees had started arriving at Nilakkal and Pamba from various parts of Kerala and neighbouring states on Saturday morning, but were allowed to leave for the shrine only by 2 pm. The pilgrims will be allowed to climb the 18 holy steps after the\u00a0padi puja\u00a0to have\u00a0darshan. The portals of the hill shrine, located in a reserve forest in Western Ghats in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, were opened for the two-month-long Mandalam Makaravilakku pilgrimage season around 5 pm.\nWomen can enter temple shrine,\u00a0but state govt will not provide police protection\nAlthough women will be allowed entry in the temple, as the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 order still stands, the Kerala government has decided not to provide police protection to women of the prohibited age group who plan to visit the temple.\nSeveral ministers in the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet have said that law and order must be maintained and \u201cwomen activists should be keep away from the Sabarimala temple\u201d.\nKerala Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran on Friday said that \u201cThis (Sabarimala shrine) is not a place for activism and the LDF government would not support those who make announcements about entering the hill shrine for the sake of publicity\u201d.\nKerala Devaswom Board Minister K Surendran: State government won't provide protection to any woman visiting Sabarimala Temple. Activists like Trupti Desai shouldn't see Sabarimala as a place to show their strength. If she needs police protection, she should get an order from SC. pic.twitter.com/0wecBgOsgc\nThose who want to visit the temple can procure a court order to enter the temple, he said.\nIn view of this, Pune-based women\u2019s right activist, Trupti Desai, who last year tried to defy the centuries-old ban on entry of women and was eventually sent back after protests from devotees, said she would be visiting the temple regardless of being denied police protection by the Kerala government.\nBut there have been conflicting reports about the day Desai wanted to visit the temple and offer prayers. Few publications have said that she would go to the shrine after 20 November, but PTI reported she would be reaching on 17 November.\n\u201cIf women need protection to trek the hills, police should provide the same. Whether government gives protection or not we will be reaching on 17 November to offer prayers,\u201d Desai said.\nLaw Minister AK Balan said if anyone tries to hamper the darshan of the devotees, the government would take strong action.\n\u201cIf someone thinks that they can exploit the devotees by spreading lies and turn them against the government, let me tell you, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\nAttempts by around a dozen women, including activists and journalists in the 10-50 years age group, to climb the sacred hills had come to nought last year as frenzied devotees of Lord Ayyappa heckled and hassled them and forced them to retreat.\nHowever, defying protesters, two women, in their 40s \u2013 Bindu Ammini and Kanakadurga , had entered the Ayyappa temple in January this year and offered prayers scripting history.\nKerala witnessed\u00a0outrage by right-wing outfits after Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 verdict to allow women inside\u00a0sanctum sanctorum\nThe state and temple precincts had witnessed frenzied protests by right outfits and BJP workers\u00a0in 2018 after the LDF government had decided to implement the Supreme court\u2019s verdict of 28 September to allow women of all age groups to offer prayers at the shrine.\nFor centuries women in the menstruating age group of 10- 50 years were barred from entering the temple.\nHowever, this year, even though the top court has not stayed its verdict on entry of young women into the shrine while posting various petitions on the matter to a larger bench, the government is exercising caution.\nThe five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday said a seven-judge bench will re-examine various religious issues , including the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple and mosques and the practice of female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra community.\nA 3:2 verdict decided to keep pending the pleas seeking a review of its decision regarding the entry of women into the shrine, and said restrictions on women in religious places was not restricted to Sabarimala alone and was prevalent in other religions as well.\nAll arrangements in place for pilgrim season\nThe CPM-led LDF government has made all preparations to make it a hassle free pilgrimage. Kandararu Mahesh Mohanararu would open the sanctum sanctorum and perform the pujas.\nAK Sudheer Namboodiri would take charge as the Sabarimala Melsanthi and MS Parameshwaran Namboodiri as Malikapuram Melsanthi.\nThe resting places for the devotees at Nilackal, Pamba and Sannidhanam has already been set up along with medical, water and toilet facilities. Over 10,000 police personnel would be posted in phases in and around the Lord Ayyappa temple for security purposes during the pilgrim season.\nThe temple, dedicated to Lord Ayyappa is the most famous and prominent among all the Sastha temples in Kerala, is situated on a hilltop about 4000 feet above sea level \u2013\u00a0Sabarimala. The devotees have to trek through difficult paths in the forest as the vehicles can go only up to pamba.\nWith inputs from TK Devasia, a Kerala-based journalist, and PTI\nFind us on YouTube\nis on YouTube\nCopyright @ 2024.

Police have registered cases against more than 50 people, local media reported.\nFor centuries, the Sabarimala temple in Kerala state has banned women or girls older than 10, but that was judged illegal by India's Supreme Court which ruled last month that it infringed the right to worship.\nKerala's Communist government pledged to uphold the ruling and deployed some 500 police, including 100 women officers, to the site.\n\"Nobody will be allowed to prevent anybody. We will do everything possible to implement the law of the land,\" said Inspector General of Police Manoj Abraham. \"None will be allowed to take law into their hands.\"\nBut while thousands of bare-chested men entered the temple with offerings of tumeric and incense when it opened at 5:00 pm (1130 GMT) for the first time since the court decision, there were no signs of any women going in.\nFootage from CNN NEWS 18 showed police chasing protesters through dense forest near Nilakkal, the main entry point to the temple, which is about 18 km (11 miles) further away.

Camera crews from several other channels had their vehicles vandalised.\nPilgrims have for centuries visited the Sabarimala temple, in a remote tiger reserve in the Western Ghats mountain range.\nMany of those visiting the site take a vow of celibacy for 41 days before beginning a trek through the mountains to the temple, located around 3,000 feet (900 metres) above sea level, according to the temple's website.\n\u09a8\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a6 \u09ac\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8, \u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09be \u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09b2\u09dc\u09be\u0987, \u098f\u0987 \u09b2\u09dc\u09be\u0987\u09df\u09c7 \u099c\u09bf\u09a4\u09a4\u09c7 \u09b9\u09ac\u09c7\u0964",

This short story is lesson 10 in the textbook of Class 11. This short story is written by Doris Lessing. The story theme is about the attack of Locusts and the efforts of farmers which they make to save their fields. If you are a student of FSC, 1st year and you need question answers of other short stories too, you can visit this link. I have also shared a post with complete 1st year English Notes.\nThis story shows man working against the heavy odds of nature against him. The fact becomes clear that the power of human beings is no match for the power of Nature. We learn that before Nature, human beings are helpless. Man\u2019s optimism makes him great and going.\nIn the story, crops are attacked by a large swarm of locusts. The farmers make a noise, light fire to produce acrid and black smoke. But the locusts destroy everything, leaving no blade of grass behind. The farmers, instead of losing heart, plan for the coming days which makes them great in the readers\u2019 eyes. There is no blinking the fact that defeat never comes to a man until he admits it.\nHereunder, you will see 10 questions with answers of the short story, the mild attack of locusts and 11 Question Answers from Kips English Notes.\nAns. Locusts are large insects that fly in large groups. They live in hot countries and destroy crops.\nAns. They threw wet leaves on fire to make the smoke acrid and black so that the locusts might be kept from landing on their farms.\nAns. Every farmer hoped that the locusts would overlook his farm and go on to the next farm.\nAns. No, she did not know anything to keep the locusts away. She was wondering what to do to help them.\nAns. All the trees were queer and still. They were clotted with insects. Their boughs weighed down to the ground.\nAns. He picked the stray locust off his shirt and split it down with his thumbnail. It was filled with eggs.\nAns. No, not at all. The hoppers are not different from the locusts as they are the young ones of locusts. They are identical to them.\nAns. Yes, she lost heart on the loss of crops. She thought that it was bad enough. She thought that the devastated and mangled countryside was a ruin.\nAns. Locusts are compared to bad weather because they are as disastrous as bad weather. Both have harmful effects on crops.\nAns. The men ate their supper with good appetites because they were satisfied with their work. They were not much worried. According to them, the situation could have been much worse.\nHere are additional 11 Questions with Answers from 1st Year English Chapter 10 A Mild Attack of Locusts. Students should go through these short questions too.\nAns. The farmers tried to prevent the main swarm of locusts from landing on their farms by raising smoke, beating old bits of metal, and making much noise.\nAns. They were trying to prevent the main swarm from setting and laying eggs so that the hoppers, later on, might not create more destruction.\nAns. When the locusts had moved to the south the lands looked devastated and mangled. There was not a blade of grass left on the farm.\nAns. Over the rocky levels of the mountains, they saw a streak of rust-coloured air. They were actually locusts.\nAns. The old ploughshare hanging from a tree branch was used to summon labourers at moments of crisis.\nAns. The farm was ringing with the clamour of the gong and the labourers could be seen pouring out of the compound. Smoke was rising everywhere.\nAns. The main swarm showed in a dense black cloud, reaching almost to the sun itself while the front guards of the swarm looked like reddish veils.\nAns. The swarms of the locusts had covered the farm-land. The locusts were crawling everywhere so the earth seemed to be moving.\nAns. The evening air was no longer black and thick. It was clear blue with a pattern of insects whizzing through it.\nAns. On seeing the locusts, Richard, at once, called the cook boy and sent him to beat the old ploughshare in order to summon all the labourers at this moment of crisis.\nAns. The main swarm of locusts was not setting because they were looking for a place to settle and lay eggs.\nYou may also Like:\nThis post has an example of an Essay on My Neighbour for Class 10 Students in English.

At the bottom of the website, in its \"about\" section, it has a disclaimer that says, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\"\nThis website is identical to other fake news sites we have fact-checked, such as www.breakingnews365.net and www.breakingnews247.net. All these sites have identical home pages that allow users to create their own fake news articles, enticing users to come up with \"catchy titles\" that \"make your friends curious.\"\nEven if you did not scroll to the bottom of the page to see the disclaimer, there are other ways to figure out that the article is false.\nIf you are a grandparent and you are not picking up your grandkids every weekend, you have not been jailed or fined. That\u2019s one way to tell.\nAnother way to check is to go on the website GovTrack.us. They have compiled a database with all of the bills considered, voted on and enacted.\nUsing this database, we searched all bills enacted during Obama\u2019s administration related to grandparents. There was no law that mandated grandparents to pick up their grandchildren every weekend.\nThe unknown author of this article made up the statement that said Obama signed a law that grandparents have to spend time with their grandchildren on the weekend, so we rate the statement as Pants on Fire!\nThe Principles of the Truth-O-Meter\nwww.react365.com, Obama passed law for grandparents to get all their grandchildren every weekend\nwww.react365.com, Prank Your Friends Now\nhttp://www.breakingnews365.net, Prank Your Friends Now\nwww.breakingnews247.net, Prank Your Friends Now\nPolitiFact, Carnival isn\u2019t giving hurricane victims a free cruise, despite fake news post, Sept. 21, 2017\nPolitiFact, No, Washington state did not change its name because George Washington owned slaves, Sept. 27, 2017\nGovTrack, Statistics and Historical Comparison\nIn a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\nSign me up\nDistrict of Columbia\n1800 I Street NW\nWashington, DC 20006\nFlorida\n801 3rd St. S\nSt. Petersburg, FL 33701\n727-821-9494",

He posted a photograph of himself on 27 July 2016:\nClickbait stories such as celebrity death hoaxes are common ways for dubious web sites and apps to spread malware. \u00a0Even if the sites don't spread invasive software outright, your computer or social media accounts can still be easily hijacked so that unscrupulous companies can profit from a seemingly large social media presence.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Jaden Smith suicide hoax: Will Smith's son, 18, is \u2026\nWill Smith\u2019s son Jaden Smith was the butt of a cruel death hoax rumour this week\nJaden Smith, the 18-year-old son of Hollywood stars Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith was the subject of a death hoax on Thursday.\nRumours that Jaden \u2014 the star of films like The Pursuit of Happyness, The Karate Kid and After Earth \u2014 had passed away began doing the rounds over Wednesday. On social media, there was speculation that the teenaged actor had committed suicide .\nThe hoax received further impetus when it was found that Jaden had not tweeted from his handle since 8 July.\nBefore the hoax rumours began circulating, Jaden has been in the news for his 18th birthday celebrations in London, his Netflix show The Get Down and his relationship with model Sarah Snyder, 21.\nThe hoax seems to have been an elaborate one , with a website asking readers to allow it certain app permissions before allowing them to read the \u201cnews story\u201d. Those who did give the \u201capp\u201d permission found the \u201cnews item\u201d shared from their Facebook accounts, replicating the \u201creport\u201d across several feeds and giving it the appearance of credibility. Such clickbait headlines are usually used by sites to get malware onto readers\u2019 systems.\nIn recent times, Jaden and Sarah have been at the centre of gossip websites\u2019attention after it was reported that she \u201ccheated on him with an Atlanta-based photographer\u201d.\nJaden and Sarah, however, seemed to be in perfectly fine spirits when they appeared at the Suicide Squad premiere (in which Jaden\u2019s dad Will Smith stars as Deadshot) this week.\nFind us on YouTube\nis on YouTube\nCopyright @ 2024.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn mid-2017, an article published on the web site Women's News (WNews.world) gained notoriety among social media users, thanks to its outlandish claim that an Indonesian woman deceased for three years not only returned to life and walked among the living, but was actually photographed doing so:\nThe text of the article makes reference to a \"special rite\" used by the locals to bring the corpse back to life:\nIn Indonesia, in the town of Toraja, a woman leaves her grave after being dead for 3 years.\nFortunately, this event was caught on camera and it\u2019s the evidence of how this woman was resurrected after that much time.\nThere is no doubt that this is a frightening and surprising fact.\nThey say that in order to bring her back to life, a special rite is performed in the place of the woman\u2019s tomb.\nThe premise struck us as both preposterous and familiar, so we dug deeper and found many other versions, including one that was posted to the snopes.com message board in September 2010:\nWe found an even older version posted on an Indonesian blog in November 2009. It included the writer's personal reminiscences around witnessing a \"walking corpse\" in his or her youth (although the narrative suffers a bit due to machine translation):\nThe story of a dead corpse has been around since time immemorial. Hundreds of years ago it was said that there was a civil war in Tana Toraja namely the Toraja West fought against the East Toraja people. In the battle the West Toraja was defeated because most of them were killed, but at the time of going home their entire corpse of the Toraja West was walking, while the East Toraja people though only a few were killed but they took the corpses of their dead brother, Then the war is considered a series. On the next offspring the Toraja people often bury their corpses by way of the corpse walking alone to the grave.\nThe phenomenon of \"Walking bodies\" that I myself have witnessed directly. The incident occurred around the year 1992 (I'm new grade 3 elementary). At that time in my village there was a man named Pongbarrak whose mother died. Such as Toraja custom the corpse is not directly buried but still has to go through a customary procession of burial (signs solo '). At that time after bathing the dead body of the mother is placed in bed in a special room before it is inserted into the coffin. On the third night the whole family gathered to talk about how the funeral procession would take place. At that time I sat on the porch of the house understand the children so like to pace. But after the meeting is over (around 10 pm), suddenly there is a noise in the house where some mothers shout. Out of curiosity I tried to look into the house and the dead man was walking out of the room, just cash me and my friends screamed hysterically and ran down the stairs. I ran and got my dad hysterically scared. After that I was taken home by father and I do not know what happened next.\nCommon to every variant we've encountered are references to the Tana Toraja region of South Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia. (If you've ever tasted any of the earthy, subtly spicy coffees imported from Sulawesi, odds are the beans were grown and hand-harvested in Tana Toraja.) Nor is it a coincidence that virtually every travel guide offering information about the remote location spotlights certain \"peculiar,\" \"complex,\" and purportedly \"gruesome\" funerary practices found there (practices that are indeed so unusual and elaborate that entire books have been written about them and tourists flock to record them on their mobile devices). The more we learned about these traditions, the more we became convinced they were the inspiration for tales about Indonesia's so-called \"walking dead.\"\nIt's unclear precisely how long the Toraja people, who descended from Austronesian speakers living in central Sulawesi well before Europeans arrived in the 1500s, have inhabited the island. During the 1700s, the Toraja population was driven into the southern mountains (where the majority of them are still concentrated) by another ethnic subgroup, the Buginese. Although most Toraja now identify as Christian or Muslim, many still honor beliefs and customs handed down from their ancestors \u2014 beliefs and customs in which death takes center stage.\nAnthropologist Kelli Swazey described the Torajans' intimate, intricate relationship with the dead in a 2013 TED Talk entitled \"Life that Doesn't End with Death\":\nIn Tana Toraja, the most important social moments in people's lives, the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners, but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals \u2014 pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo -- that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death, the ritual enactment of the end of life, has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair, where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead.\nIn Toraja society, Swazey explains, death is seen as a process -- and a lengthy process, at that -- rather than as a singular event:\nSo where we see an unquestionable reality, death as an irrefutable biological condition, Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again, the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact, a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation....\nUntil the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person's physical death, the deceased is referred to as \"to makala,\" a sick person, or \"to mama,\" a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for, and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions, which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya.\nSo I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives? And that's exactly what I'm saying.\nA National Geographic video shot in 2016 provides brief glimpses into Tana Toraja death and burial rites (warning: includes graphic scenes of animal sacrifice):\nOf particular interest with regard to the \"walking dead\" tales we're investigating is the ma'nene ceremony, in which the mummified corpses of dead family members are exhumed, washed, reclothed, and walked through the center of town, examples can be seen both in the latter half of the National Geographic video above and this tourist video uploaded to YouTube in 2016:\nBringing our investigation full circle, Loyola University anthropology professor Kathleen Adams, who spent two years in Tana Toraja observing the lives and culture of its people, confirmed in an interview with Loyola Magazine that the \"walking dead\" stories represent a corrupted version of the truth:\n\u201cWhat started happening, as best as I can piece together, was migrants who had moved to Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia, who were often second-generation migrants, were coming back,\u201d Adams says. \u201cThe city folk would want a picture next to their deceased relatives, and the images started circulating on Facebook. Toraja became suddenly internationally associated with this idea of the \u2018walking dead\u2019 and zombies.\u201d\nThat's not to say that concept is entirely foreign to the culture. \"Torajans also tell stories about corpses that walk on their own to their final resting place,\" Kelli Swazey told us via e-mail:\nMany Torajans relate that in the past, powerful ritual practitioners could make a corpse walk on its own. This practice is not done anymore, according to many Torajans, because it is a kind of magic that is not appropriate for modern Christians, and the majority of Torajans identify as Protestant Christians today. In addition, there are many stories of other kinds of revenants that the living encounter in Indonesia, so the circulation of these kinds of stories is quite common in the Indonesian media.\nSo, folklore and media sensationalism notwithstanding, do the deceased really rise from their graves and walk in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi? Yes, but no \u2014 not literally. They do so only with the help of surviving family members, who continue to demonstrate their love and devotion long after the physical bodies of their loved ones have gone quiet.\nThe photograph does not show an actual zombie.\nBennett, Amanda. \u00a0 \"When Death Doesn't Mean Goodbye.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 National Geographic, \u00a0 March 2016.\nGaynor, Anna. \u00a0 \"One Culture's Unique Rituals for the Dead Have a Lot to Teach Us About Life.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Loyola Magazine. \u00a0 Accessed 12 July 2017.\nKugel, Seth. \u00a0 \"In Indonesia, A Region Where Death Is a Lure.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 30 July 2015.\nSwazey, Kelli. \u00a0 \"Life that Doesn't End with Death.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 TED Talks. \u00a0 April 2013.\nTomkiw, Lydia. \u00a0 \"Funeral Tourism in Sulawesi: Is It Ethical?\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 CNN. \u00a0 27 March 2013.\nWB, Stephen. \u00a0 \"Walking Dead Version Toraja.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Mamasa Online. \u00a0 10 November 2009.\nEncyclopaedia Britannica. \u00a0 \"Toraja.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 12 July 2017.\nLonely Planet. \u00a0 \"Introducing Tana Toraja.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 12 July 2017.\nWomen's News. \u00a0 \"Woman Comes Out from Her Grave and Walks After 3 Years of Being Dead.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 12 July 2017.\nDavid Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### 15 Real Instances of Actual Zombies - Ranker\nThe modern-day zombie was formalized in 1968 upon the release of George Romero's seminal Night of the Living Dead. The film featured all the typical characteristics of these supernatural ghouls: reanimated, mindless, and shuffling human corpses who eat the flesh and organs of the living. While they are slow, they are vicious in their hunger, and when they amass into a horde, they will tear you to pieces.\u00a0Often, a zombie apocalypse in films and literature signals the end of days.\nSince that time, we've seen numerous other variations on the same basic zombie characteristics. But in fact, the concept of a zombie predates Romero's film, specifically in the concept of a zombie in Haitian culture, which is effectively a person \"risen\" from the dead and brainwashed into a mindless automaton. While many insist these incidents are nothing but folklore, others insist such beings were successfully fashioned.\nWhether the Haitian zombies actually existed or not, there have been numerous cases of real zombies, though such incidents do not exactly involve things that have come back from the dead. Nature has given us both zombie ants and zombie spiders, and there have been several high-profile cases of people going berserk and feasting on the flesh of fellow humans for wholly unknown reasons. (And yes, some of them are examples of the \"living dead.\")\nLet's take a look at 15 times there were zombies actually roaming (or simply occupying) the earth.\nFlorida was already on the cannibalistic, possibly zombie-related attack map with the infamous Miami case, but that was apparently not enough for the Sunshine State.\nIn August, 2016, a 19-year-old college student, Austin Harrouf, reportedly stormed away from a restaurant in Jupiter, FL, where he'd been dining with his parents, apparently upset over the slow service there. He then wandered into a neighborhood, where a couple, Michelle Mischon and John Stevens III,\u00a0sat in their garage with the door open, enjoying a quiet evening. Harrouf pulled a switchblade on the couple and stabbed them to death, apparently without provocation. A neighbor attempted to intervene and called 911, but was stabbed by the man as well.\nWhen police arrived, they found Harrouf\u00a0naked,\u00a0ripping away chunks of the couple's flesh and eating it. He was also growling, grunting, and making \"animal noises.\" Repeated use of stun guns and a police dog could not sway Harrouf from his \"meal,\" and finally three officers had to pull the man away from the bodies by force.\nWhat makes this case especially strange is that Harrouf, prior to this bizarre crime, was a model student who seemed to have things pretty well figured out. It is reported that he had been hanging out with some of his fraternity brothers prior to joining his parents for dinner, but his toxicology report came back clean. Other test results for synthetic drugs are pending, though officials did say Harrouf showed no other characteristic symptoms\u00a0associated with substances like flakka or bath salts.\nPolice were left baffled at Harrouf's behavior. Just what exactly happened to this man to prompt such a gruesome crime?\nThis story was big news back in May 2012, especially given the eerie footage of the incident that made the rounds on the Internet. Miami resident Rudy Eugene stripped naked and attacked homeless man Ronald Poppo, eating about 80% of the man's face. When police arrived at the scene, they were forced to open fire on the belligerent Eugene. He took far more bullets than his body should have been able to withstand before finally dropping.\nKevin Santos was pronounced dead at a hospital in his hometown of Belem in Brazil. The two-year-old was placed in an airtight body bag for three hours while his family made preparations for his funeral.\nThis case was observed by researchers in Haiti sometime in 1996 or 1997. From i09:\n\"FI was around 30 years old when she died after a short febrile illness and was buried by her family the same day in the family tomb next to her house. 3 years later she was recognised by a friend wandering near the village; her mother confirmed her identity by a facial mark, as did her 7-year-old daughter, her siblings, other villagers, her husband, and the local priest. She appeared mute and unable to feed herself. Her parents accused her husband of zombifying her (he was jealous of her after she had had an affair). After a local court authorised the opening of her tomb, which was full of stones, her parents were undecided whether to take her home and she was admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Port-au Prince...\"\nClairvius Narcisse died on May 2, 1962 after admitting himself to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in\u00a0Deschapelle, a town in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti. He had been suffering from a plethora of ailments, but no direct cause for his symptoms could be determined.\nEighteen years later, in 1980, his sister Angelina saw Narcisse in a market place. He recounted the memories of his own \"death,\" including being buried alive. He had been placed into a death-like state by a bokor, or sorcerer, and after being dug up he was whisked away to a plantation to serve as a zombified laborer. He escaped after two years of slavery and wandered the Haitian countryside, only willing to return to his village when his brother, whom he believed to have made the deal with the bokor that turned Narcisse into a zombie, had finally passed away.\nNote: The video above of a purported krokodil user is both NSFW and\u00a0heartbreaking.\nKrokodil is a drug that rose to prominence in poor areas of Russia because of its potent opioid effects combined with the affordable and easy methods with which it is produced. There have been reports of the drug now cropping up in the US (a fitting homecoming, given the narcotic was patented in America in 1934).\nIf the potency of krokodil was not alarming enough, its side effects are the stuff of horror movies. The drug gets its name from the gangrenous effect it has on users' skin as it literally eats tissue and flesh from the inside out. This often leads to open sores and wounds on users' flesh that leaves their bones exposed. It can also lead to incoherence, jerking motions, and shuffling or shambling steps.\n\n### Can Zombies Be Real? 5 Shocking Truths About \u2026\nCan zombies be real? Uncover the science, history, and surprising facts about zombie myths in this detailed exploration of their possible existence.\nTable of Content\nThe idea of zombies has captured the imagination of people worldwide for centuries. From ancient folklore to modern-day movies, the concept of the dead coming back to life or being controlled by external forces continues to intrigue us. But can zombies actually be real? Are they just fictional monsters or is there a scientific or historical basis behind these walking corpses?\nThe popular depiction of zombies is as reanimated corpses or people controlled by some sort of external force. Often, they lack free will, display a hunger for human flesh, and cannot use reason. Most popularly, zombies appear in movies, television programs, and video games such as *The Walking Dead* or *Resident Evil*.\nHowever, the concept of zombies predates modern entertainment. The idea has roots in ancient cultures and folklore, especially in Haiti, where the word \u201czombie\u201d originated.\nHaitian lore features an almost prominent role in the evolution of the modern zombie myth. It is in Haitian Vodou, or Voodoo, that a zombie would be a reanimated being due to magic powers belonging to a bokor. The zombies of folk lore do not resemble movie versions as monstrous flesh eaters; they are said to be totally under the power of the bokor with no free will.\nThe process of \u201czombification\u201d is thought to involve powders and rituals. One of the most famous powders allegedly contains **tetrodotoxin**, a powerful neurotoxin found in pufferfish. In small doses, tetrodotoxin can cause paralysis and symptoms that mimic death, leading some to believe a person has \u201crisen from the dead.\u201d\nLong before Haitian folklore, however, other cultures had their version of the undead. Some of these include Norse mythology describes \u201cdraugr,\u201d reanimated corpses which guard their treasures. Medieval Europe feared \u201crevenants,\u201d corpses that could rise from the grave; rituals were performed to avoid this.\n\u2013 Ancient **Egyptians** mummified their dead to preserve them for the afterlife, a practice that influenced modern depictions of the undead.\nThese early myths show humanity\u2019s long-standing fear of death\u2014and the unsettling idea of what might happen if death could be reversed.\nThis might be an out-of-the-box idea, but some facts from this myth are true and resemble actual phenomena. Let\u2019s try to understand the scientific facts that are behind zombification.\nNature gives us several examples of organisms that exhibit zombie-like behavior due to external control:\n\u2013 Cordyceps Fungus and Insects\nIn the animal kingdom, there is a highly documented case of \u201czombification,\u201d that is Cordyceps, a fungus that infects insects, such as ants, taking over the insect\u2019s body and manipulating its actions. The infected insect climbs to a high place where it eventually dies, hence allowing the fungus to propagate and produce spores.\n\u2013 Rabies Virus\nRabies is a viral disease that can produce aggression, confusion, and loss of fear in an infected animal. Though it cannot raise the dead, rabies shows how a virus can so completely change behavior that it can transform an ordinary host into a dangerous foe.\nThese examples provide evidence that zombie-like behavior in humans could potentially be caused by a pathogen or parasite.\nAs has been explained above, tetrodotoxin has also been used in zombification tales in Haiti. This is an extremely potent toxin that can trigger the following:\n\u2013 Paralysis for some time\n\u2013 Slowed heart rate\n\u2013 Death-like trance\nIf this state is somehow reversed, it would provide the semblance of revival from death.\nIn some zombie tales, the infected person loses higher brain functions and becomes controlled by primal instincts. This is not entirely science fiction.\n\u2013 Some drugs and neurotoxins can impair the functioning of the brain, causing confusion, aggression, or unawareness.\n\u2013 Brain injuries to the frontal lobe, which governs decision-making and emotions, can also make people act like zombies.\nSome researchers and writers speculate that progress in technology or bioweapons could create a scenario of zombies.\n\u2013 Genetic engineering: Are scientists going to create accidentally-or intentionally-a virus causing zombie-like symptoms?\n\u2013 Artificial intelligence: What if it became possible to bypass the human consciousness and people started to become mindless drones?\nWhile these scenarios are just speculations, they represent how modern science may give birth to situations like the one in zombie lore.\nZombies gained a significant place in modern entertainment in the 20th century with George A. Romero\u2019s film *Night of the Living Dead* in 1968. Zombies have since then changed to represent societal fears in the form of pandemics, war, and the breakdown of civilization.\nIn recent years, shows like *The Walking Dead* and movies like *World War Z* have sparked renewed interest in zombies. These portrayals often focus on survival, human behavior during crises, and the fear of losing control.\nWhile the traditional idea of corpses rising from graves seems unlikely, certain scenarios could make a \u201czombie-like\u201d event plausible:\n\u2013 Pandemics: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed how easily diseases can spread around the world. A new virus whose symptoms include aggressiveness or confusion could be similar to a zombie attack.\n\u2013 Biological Warfare: Countries or terrorist groups could design diseases that affect the brain or induce \u201czombie-like\u201d behavior.\n\u2013 Mass Hysteria: Fear and misinformation during crises can lead to behaviors that resemble zombie panic, even without an actual disease.\nThe concept of zombies has touched one of our greatest fears:\n\u2013 Fear of death: Zombies blur the line between life and death, forcing us to confront our own mortality.\n\u2013 Loss of control: To be turned into some mindless creature is the frighteningest of concepts.\n\u2013 Societal collapse: Stories involving zombies always include civilization\u2019s breaking down, which in and of itself seems like all-too-relevant commentary upon today\u2019s climate of changing weather, pandemics, and political turmoil.\nThe word \u201czombie\u201d originates from Haitian folklore, and it describes a person who was revived and under the control of a bokor, which is a sorcerer.\nYes, in the case of insects, Cordyceps fungus can infect them and dominate their behavior. In some mammals, the rabies virus can cause altered behavior, too.\nA virus that causes aggression, confusion, or loss of higher brain functions could resemble zombie-like symptoms. However, reanimating dead bodies is not scientifically possible.\nHypothetically, genetic engineering or AI could result in scenarios similar to zombification, though those are highly speculative.\nZombies represent deep fears in the form of death, loss of control, and collapse of society, which is a very engaging subject for stories and entertainment. Read more interesting articles.\nWhile the traditional notion of zombies\u2014reanimated corpses walking the earth\u2014is still a figment of imagination, some aspects of zombie lore are based on reality. From toxins that mimic death to diseases that alter behavior, science offers plausible explanations for zombie-like phenomena.\nHowever, a catastrophic zombie apocalypse of the Hollywood films is not going to happen anytime soon. But zombies continue to captivate us \u2013 our imaginations and fears propel this phenomenon forward.\nCan zombies be real? Doubtful in the vein of the Hollywood depiction of zombies, but it doesn\u2019t rule out zombie-like occurrences based on science or other natural factors.\nYour email address will not be published.

Turnout was 43 per cent.\nFlanked by his wife Denise and his mother, the president appeared on a balcony at his campaign headquarters in the capital Kinshasa to address supporters, who braved the rain to hear him speak.\n\u201cI have been re-elected president of all Congolese,\u201d Tshisekedi, who was dressed in a white shirt and cap, told cheering supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s in this spirit of openness that I will exercise this second mandate\u201d.\nMoise Katumbi \u2014 a wealthy businessman, football club owner and former provincial governor \u2014 was the election runner-up with about 18 percent.\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s Constitutional Court is expected to confirm the provisional results on January 10.\nTshisekedi, 60, first came to power in January 2019 after a disputed election that many observers said he had in fact lost.\nMartin Fayulu \u2014 who says he was robbed of the last presidential election in 2018 \u2014 also contested this year\u2019s poll but in the end, won about five per cent of the votes.\nThe 20 remaining candidates, including Denis Mukwege, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with female victims of wartime sexual violence, were either under, or hovering around, one per cent.\nNine opposition candidates \u2014 Mukwege, Fayulu and Katumbi \u2014 on Sunday signed a declaration rejecting what they termed a \u201csham\u201d election and called for a re-run.\nFayulu, addressing reporters in the capital Kinshasa the same day, said the results \u201care a masquerade. This must not be accepted\u201d.\nTresor Kibangula, a political analyst at the Ebuteli research institute who spoke to AFP before the full provisional results were released, said Tshisekedi\u2019s vote tally \u201cis way beyond all expectations\u201d.\n\u201cHis dynamic campaign worked\u201d but his scores in some regions \u201craise questions about the impact of the irregularities that were observed\u201d.\n\u2018Numerous irregularities\u2019\nOver 40 million people out of the 100 million inhabitants of the huge country were registered to vote on December 20 for president, as well as for national and regional lawmakers and municipal councillors.\nInitially scheduled for December 20, voting was officially extended by a day to account for problems, and continued for days afterwards in remote areas, according to observers.\nOne Catholic-Protestant observation mission said it \u201cdocumented numerous cases of irregularities susceptible to have affected the integrity of the vote\u201d.\nAbout 15 embassies have called for \u201crestraint\u201d in the poor but mineral-rich country where post-election tensions have been common.\nAuthorities say they have taken steps to prevent unrest, especially in the mining areas of the southeast that are Katumbi\u2019s stronghold.\nThey also stress that any electoral disputes must be presented to the Constitutional Court.\nBut opposition leaders say they have no confidence in the court or Ceni, which they argue is subservient to the government.\nAccording to AFP reporters, security was tighter in Kinshasa on Sunday, as well as in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi.\nDR Congo's Constitutional Court Tuesday confirmed President Felix Tshisekedi's landslide victory in a December election for a second term in the poor but mineral-rich massive central African country. Tshisekedi got 73.47 per cent of the vote during a December 20 election, the court said.

The shirts appear to be in a Comic Sans font, and those wearing them are holding up a sign supporting the New York Police Department, prompting Snopes readers to ask us if they were members of the NYPD.\nThe shirts would appear to be both a dark and flippant play on words stemming from one of the last statements uttered by Floyd before he died on May 25, which was \"I can't breathe.\"\nBut the image actually shows protesters from a demonstration in December 2014, months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, at the hands of an NYPD officer, and more than five years before the death of George Floyd.\nIn July 2014, Garner died as a result of police officer Daniel Pantaleo placing him in a chokehold. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for protesters calling for an end to police killings of black people. In early December 2014, a grand jury found \"no reasonable cause\" to bring charges against Pantaleo, triggering protests. In July 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered that the case against Pantaleo be dropped, and a month later, Pantaleo was fired from the NYPD.\nAccording to one report from the 2014 demonstration, about 100 people gathered outside New York's City Hall in support of the NYPD on Dec. 19, while other reports said the number was closer to 50. The pro-NYPD gathering, organized by a group called Thank You NYPD, faced off against around 200 counter-protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Organizers from Thank You NYPD told The Village Voice\u00a0that their group was not made up of police officers, but \"citizens who appreciate the safety that the NYPD provides our great city. Ten million people policed by 35,000 officers is one hell of a task to handle.\"\nAt the demonstration, the pro-NYPD protesters chanted \"Don't resist arrest\" when the anti-police brutality demonstrators chanted \"I can't breathe.\"\nA video from the protest, by ReasonTV, sets the scene:\nA 2014 report from Gawker included some of the shirt-wearer's perspectives. An attendee named Mike Stables\u00a0had flown in from Colorado for the protest, bringing \"I Can Breathe\" T-shirts with him.\nWhile it is not clear whether many NYPD cops were part of the protests or wearing the shirts, a number of people close to the police were present. Some attendees included a retired NYPD detective and a mother of an NYPD officer. According to CBS, neither Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, nor police unions, endorsed the rally because of concerns about violence. Bratton expected a low turnout. Patrick Lynch, a police union leader, complained about the lack of support from New York City's mayor and his administration:\nPetulant police union leader Pat Lynch recently complained of the lack of support coming from City Hall: \"If they're not going to support us when we need 'em, we'll embarrass them when we can.\"\nIn the above video, a pro-NYPD protester at City Hall responded to a journalist's comment on how the police use force to defend themselves: \"They do it with force -- well, no, we're not allowed to use force.\"\nSteven W. Thrasher, a columnist and faculty member at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, reflected on his coverage of the December 2014 protest for Contexts. By his account, off-duty cops were indeed present:\nHere I was, being 'protected' by the NYPD on duty, surrounded by angry, white, retired and off-duty cops and their supporters. Who hated the press and, it seemed, Black people \u2014 and I was in the middle of them.\nAnother report from Gothamist relates an exchange between protesters, indicating more off-duty cops were present:\n\"Where's your badge?\" one woman asked a man on the police side.\n\"It's in my pocket!\" the man replied.\n\"Why don't you take it out?\"\n\"I don't have to, I'm not on duty, bitch!\"\n... \"My boss told me to behave myself tonight,\" said Scott, a police officer who works in Connecticut.\nIt is clear from multiple reports that off-duty cops were indeed present at the pro-police side of the rally, but we are still unable to determine if any of them were wearing the shirts saying \"I Can Breathe.\" We do know that these images are from a 2014 rally supporting the NYPD after the death of Garner, and not in response to the death of Floyd. We thus rate this image as \"Miscaptioned.\"\nThe Associated Press.\u00a0 \u00a0\"From Eric Garner's death to firing of NYPD officer: A timeline of key events.\" \u00a0 \u00a020 August 2019.\nBenner, Katie.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Eric Garner's Death Will Not Lead to Federal Charges for N.Y.P.D.

NYPD plainclothes officer Daniel Pantaleo then placed the 43-year-old in a chokehold that killed him.\nGarner\u2019s last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that erupted in 2014.\nIn early December of that year, a Staten Island grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo, igniting widespread protests against the NYPD and then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\nAfter a protracted federal investigation also produced no indictment, the City\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board brought charges against Pantaleo that resulted in his firing by NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill in August 2019. This added fuel to the cops\u2019 hostility to de Blasio but did not diminish activists\u2019 ire against the former mayor \u2014 given that it took five years to simply get Pantaleo off the force.\nBut as anyone who watched Ramsey Orta\u2019s viral cell-phone video of the fatal incident can attest, Pantaleo was not the only officer involved in Garner\u2019s death.\nAlthough Garner\u2019s mother Gwen Carr and the grassroots organization the Justice Committee have consistently pushed for accountability for the other officers involved, no one other than Pantaleo has faced meaningful disciplinary action. Despite clear negligence at the murder scene and blatant lies in their initial reports, many of the Garner cops have since been promoted.\nThe Indypendent calculates that since 2014, these same six officers have received over $7.5 million in salaries (plus overtime) from the city, an expenditure that increases substantially when including pensions and health care.\nLet\u2019s review the Garner cops\u2019 handiwork.\nA few months before the Garner killing, NYPD Chief of Department Phil Banks called attention to untaxed cigarette sales on Bay Street, near the ferry terminal. Prior to the mid-July incident, Banks ordered a crackdown. (Banks, later implicated in an untaxed liquor racket, is now the most powerful deputy mayor in the Adams administration.)\nStarting in March 2014, Lt. Christopher Bannon of the 120th Precinct monitored the Bay Street site for the sale of loosies. Over the next two months cops arrested Garner twice for the low-level infraction.\nA cell phone video of Eric Garner being choked to death by NYPD police was seen by millions and helped ignite calls for sweeping changes in policing.\nOn July 17, Lt. Bannon and Sergeant Dhanan Saminath sent officers Pantaleo and Justin D\u2019Amico to 200 Bay St. Both Pantaleo and D\u2019Amico knew Garner from previous encounters. D\u2019Amico told CCRB investigators that he understood Lt. Bannon\u2019s original directions to mean \u201cmake an arrest if he observed illegal activity.\u201d\nThe two officers dubiously explained to the CCRB that on the ride over to Bay Street, \u201cthey did not speak to each other about the assignment.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe only conversation that they had was about what was on the radio.\u201d The duo parked over 300 feet from 200 Bay Street. From that distance, D\u2019Amico maintained that he saw Garner make a loosie transaction \u2014 whereas Pantaleo said that a car blocked his view.\nWhen confronted by the officers, Garner made it clear that he was sick of being harassed, ominously stating \u201cI\u2019m tired of it. This stops today.\u201d\nAfter calling in back-up, Pantaleo initiates the deadly encounter, choking Garner for about 10 seconds. As Garner asserts \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 11 times, Pantaleo presses Garner\u2019s head into the sidewalk for another few seconds. Even though D\u2019Amico and three uniformed cops now had Garner in handcuffs, Pantaleo claimed that the face press was necessary in order to keep Garner \u201cfrom biting.\u201d\nAs Garner lay limp, none of the officers did anything to help him, with D\u2019Amico later explaining that he thought the victim was \u201cplaying possum.\u201d\nBoth Pantaleo and D\u2019Amico later said that they opted not to use pepper spray because they did not want to douse each other. D\u2019Amico has also claimed that he never heard Garner say \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nAt the scene, Pantaleo repeatedly told Sgt. Saminath that he saw Garner selling a loosie and that instead of a chokehold, he pulled the big man down by his shirt. The lying had only just begun.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, Sgt. Saminath texted Lt. Bannon that \u201cDanny [and] Justin went to collar Garner [and] he resisted. While they were trying to gain control of him he went into cardiac arrest\u2026Might be doa.\u201d\n\u201cThey observed him selling [a loosie],\u201d Saminath\u2019s text further stated, but after Garner refused to comply, \u201cDanny then tried to grab him and they both fell down.\u201d\n\u201cNot a big deal,\u201d Lt. Bannon responded to Saminath\u2019s distorted account, \u201cwe were effecting a lawf[ul] arrest.\u201d According to Hell Gate\u2019s Nick Pinto, Bannon\u2019s callous statement caused \u201can uproar\u201d when it surfaced in the 2019 departmental trial. On the stand, Bannon claimed that he was simply trying to put his officers\u2019 \u201cmind[s] at ease,\u201d given that they had experienced a \u201cbad situation.\u201d\nAfter leaving the crime scene, D\u2019Amico returned to the precinct and filed false paperwork. In addition to claiming that there had been no use of force, his arrest report then charged Garner with felony cigarette sales, meaning he had 10,000 or more. At the 2021 judicial inquiry into Garner\u2019s death, D\u2019Amico said this was an honest mistake. \u201cDue to the circumstances, I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly,\u201d he stated.\nSoon after Ramsey Orta\u2019s cellphone video went viral, PIX 11 reported that the footage contradicted a police report that quoted both Sgt. Saminath and Sgt. Kizzy Adonis expressing doubts regarding the severity of Garner\u2019s condition. Adonis, a Black woman, was charged by the NYPD with failure to supervise at the scene, eventually losing 20 vacation days. Saminath was not charged. Officers Mark Ramos and Craig Furlani, who piled on top of Garner and aided in handcuffing him, faced no penalties.\nAs of June 2024, Christopher Bannon is Lt. Commander Detective of the NYPD\u2019s Central Robbery Division, a high-level unit that operates out of 1 Police Plaza. Adonis and Saminath remain sergeants with desk jobs. In the fall of 2022, D\u2019Amico was promoted to detective at the 122nd Precinct on Staten Island\u2019s South Shore.\nIn 2023, Bannon added $93k in overtime to his base pay of $150k. Adonis boosted her $118k salary with $53k, while Saminath bumped up his same salary with an extra $90k. D\u2019Amico added nearly $50k to his $104k salary. Ramos and Furlani both retired a few years ago at the 20-year mark.\nFor the Garner cops, the case really wasn\u2019t such a big deal, after all.\nMeanwhile, Gwen Carr, a retired MTA train operator, continues to fight police brutality. In 2020 she pushed the state legislature to pass the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, outlawing the dangerous tactic. Two years ago, she launched the E.R.I.C. Initiative, a nonprofit that helps families affected by police violence.\nCarr is also trying to sustain the national momentum for police reform, which has waned since the 2020 George Floyd protests. This past spring at the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Carr along with relatives of Floyd and Tyre Nichols, denounced the lack of commitment by elected leaders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for our children,\u201d said Carr. \u201cBut we want to save other children.\u201d\nThe Indypendent\u00a0is a New York City-based\u00a0newspaper\u00a0and website.\u00a0Our independent, grassroots journalism is made possible by\u00a0readers like you.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A police cruiser constantly sits a few feet from a small floral memorial to Eric Garner on the Staten Island sidewalk where he spent his dying moments five years ago.\nTompkinsville Park, which police were targeting for patrols when they encountered Garner selling loose, untaxed cigarettes, remains a gathering place for desperate people.\nExpletives flew on a recent hot afternoon as park regulars discussed everything from drugs and mental illness to jail conditions and the bail paid so they could sit on a park bench.\nIt was the day after Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill announced his decision to fire the white officer who put Garner in a chokehold, hastening his death and making the man\u2019s dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.\nOn Wednesday, the police department said it had resolved a disciplinary case against a supervisor who responded to the chaotic scene.\n\u201cIf the police are here, they just move to the other side of the park and do their business there,\u201d said longtime resident Lisa Soto, taking a long drag from a cigarette. \u201cThey sell everything here. Nothing has changed.\u201d\nThat may be, some residents say, because police officers are now much more careful about how they interact with people \u2014 more cautious when dealing with suspects and less likely to bother with the kind of nuisance enforcement that was a priority five years ago.\n\u201cWhen you give a lot of leeway like that, the place becomes lawless,\u201d said resident Doug Brinson. \u201cIt\u2019s been lawless for five years. Five years people do what they want to do on this block. Five years straight.\u201d\nBert Bernan, a former construction worker on disability, said respect for the police has plummeted and he sees crime as having risen in the neighborhood where he grew up in the 1960s.\n\u201cI remember, me and my friends, if we were goofing off on the corner and the cop waved a nightstick at you, you knew, get the hell off the corner and don\u2019t give him any lip,\u201d Bernan said. \u201cBack then, you didn\u2019t have hoodlums hanging out on street corners; what we have here is a disgrace.\u201d\nPolice statistics show crime is down in the precinct where the neighborhood is located. Through second week of August last year, for example, there were 186 reported robberies or burglaries and 199 felony assaults. This year there have been 97 robberies or burglaries and 178 assaults.\nGarner\u2019s death five summers ago was an inflection point for the New York Police Department. Caught on video, the fatal encounter between Garner, a black man, and Officer Daniel Pantaleo led the nation\u2019s largest police force to train officers to de-escalate confrontations and to reassess how they interact with the public.\nA bystander\u2019s cellphone video showed Pantaleo wrapping his arm around Garner\u2019s neck and taking him to the ground with a banned chokehold near where the Staten Island Ferry takes commuters and tourists to and from Manhattan.\nAfter Garner\u2019s death, the police department required all 36,000 officers to undergo three days of training, including classes focused on de-escalation. Last year, it began training officers on fair and impartial policing, teaching them to recognize biases and rely on facts, not racial stereotypes.\nIn March, it finished outfitting all patrol officers with body cameras. And the department now requires officers to detail the actions they took each time they used force \u2014 not just when they fired their gun.\nFollowing a court ruling and a policy shift, the city dramatically reduced officers\u2019 use of stop and frisk, a practice in which officers stop people on the streets and search them for weapons. In 2011, the NYPD reported 685,724 such stops. Last year, there were about 11,000.\n\u201cThat has led to hundreds of thousands of fewer police-civilian encounters, each of which has the potential to escalate into something like what happened to Eric Garner,\u201d said Christopher Dunn, a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said his priority for the department is to ensure something like Garner\u2019s death never happens again.\n\u201cThe NYPD of today is a different institution than it was just a few years ago,\u201d de Blasio said Monday after the department fired Pantaleo.\n\u201cI know the NYPD has changed profoundly. I know that members of the NYPD learned the lessons of this tragedy. They acted on it, they did something about it. It is a beginning, but we have a lot more to do, and the change has to get deeper and deeper. And that is not a top-down enterprise \u2014 that is for all of us to do.\u201d\nIn his reaction to Pantaleo\u2019s firing, the head of the city\u2019s main police union noted a retreat some Staten Island residents say they\u2019re already seeing.\n\u201cRight now, nothing\u2019s really getting enforced,\u201d said Pat Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is, the public calls 911 and we respond. Quality-of-life issues are not being enforced. If it is enforced, the district attorneys\u2019 offices are throwing them out and downgrading them. The message is clear: Don\u2019t go out and do your job.\u201d\nIn the years since Garner\u2019s death, use-of-force complaints against the NYPD have fallen sharply, according to data compiled by the city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board. In 2014, there were 2,412. In 2018, there were 1,752, marking a 27% drop.\nA study released in February showed the NYPD had been sued for misconduct 10,656 times in the last five years and paid $361.5 million in settlements. The city paid Garner\u2019s family $5.9 million in 2015 to settle a wrongful death claim.\nO\u2019Neill, who ascended to the post in 2016, led the department\u2019s shift from the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory of policing, embraced by his predecessor Bill Bratton, that viewed low-level offenses such as selling loose cigarettes and jumping subway turnstiles as a gateway to bigger crimes.\nO\u2019Neill, who was the department\u2019s chief of patrol at the time of Garner\u2019s death, implemented a neighborhood policing model as commissioner that is designed to give patrol officers more time to walk around and interact with people in the communities they police rather than staying in their cars and responding only to 911 calls.\nBut critics say that \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory hasn\u2019t gone away, and that officers are finding new low-level targets, such as immigrant delivery people who get around on electric bikes. And while the use of stop and frisk has dropped significantly, statistics show the same racial disparities exist.\nSince Garner\u2019s death, the police department has also gotten cagier about officer discipline and hasn\u2019t always provided the public with the names of officers involved in shootings, critics say.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone backward, and we would argue that in some cases especially around police transparency they\u2019ve gone backward by decades,\u201d said Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform.\nThe NYPD has retreated in recent years from disclosing punishment details in most disciplinary cases, citing a state law that keeps personnel records secret. O\u2019Neill has said he supports changing the law. The union opposes changes.\n___\nAssociated Press video journalist David R.

The tremors sparked a tsunami that swept away towns and cities and even caused a nuclear emergency as it hit a power plant.\nThe disaster left more than 20,000 people dead or missing, and many areas are still recovering.\nSee how the rebuild and recovery effort has progressed over the past decade below.\nThe tsunami\u00a0triggered by the earthquake\u00a0slammed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, destroying its power and cooling systems and triggering meltdowns at three reactors.\nTen years later, as the photo on the left shows, the recovery efforts are still under way. Last week, a fuel pool that had been\u00a0damaged and left uncovered after the disaster, was removed. The photo taken in 2021 shows how little rebuilding had been achieved at the plant.\u00a0Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga visited\u00a0Fukushima on March 6, promising to accelerate decontamination efforts so all remaining no-go zones can be reopened. He did not give a timeline.\nSome areas up to\u00a010 kilometres from\u00a0Fukushima Daiichi are still a no-go zone.\nTwo days after the tsunami swept hundreds of towns away, streets in the area of Tagajo, Miyagi prefecture, remained flooded. The area recovered its manufacturing capabilities to pre-disaster levels\u00a0in 2013, and the economy grew by 19 per cent between 2010 and 2018.\nToday, the area, pictured on January 25 this year, almost looks like the tsunami never happened, but over the past decade the population there has shrunk 2.5 per cent. In the aftermath, local government built 532 apartments in Tagajo to house those who had lost everything, a decision some say made residents isolated from their communities.\nThe photo taken on April 6 2011, as the whole of Japan still reeled from the tsunami, shows the extent of devastation coastal communities experienced.\nHouses washed away as water and debris rushed into the town of Otsuchi.\nThe town, pictured this January on the right-hand slide, features a white phone booth where residents 'call' those dead and lost as part of the grieving process.\nThe phone booth was built by Itaru Sasaki, who owns the garden in Otsuchi, about 500 kilometres\u00a0northeast of Tokyo, a few months before the disaster, after he lost his cousin to cancer.\nMinamisanriku lost 800 residents in the tsunami, and has sprung back in an unusual fashion.\nNine staff at\u00a0Minami Sanriku Hotel Kanyo have\u00a0lead daily hour-long bus tours showing the sites of devastation and talking about their experiences.\nThe bus stops at a former school that was damaged by the tsunami, a disaster prevention centre where 43 workers died and a former wedding ceremony hall.\nSince the tours began, they have had about 400,000 participants.\nKesennuma, on the coast of Sanriku is famous for its plentiful fishing grounds. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, a trawler was left grounded in the town, pictured above.\nThe city lost 1,246 of its residents and the rebuilding effort has been long and arduous. But today, pictured on the right,\u00a0the city is working on attracting tourists.\nThe nearby Karakawa Penisula Visitor Centre features an exhibition dedicated to the tsunami and its impact on the area.\nMost popular today\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018Sleeping Prince\u2019 dies after 20 years in coma\nTour de France 2025: Tadej Pogacar misses out on hat-trick but extends his lead as Remco Evenepoel drops out\nCartoon for July 19, 2025\nOns Jabeur's tennis timeout shows growing need to address problem of player burnout\nDubai Metro Blue Line: How city's mega-project is being delivered\nBabar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan can come back into Pakistan's T20 team \u2013 here's how\nAs the UAE's population exceeds 11 million, here's where it all began\nSyrian troops sent back to Sweida as ceasefire fails to stop sectarian bloodletting\nSharjah suspect coerced his family into global drug smuggling network, says ministry\nUAE condemns Israeli plan to seize control of Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron\n\n### Washi Lantern Garden lights up for 10th and final time \u2026\n\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u95b2\u89a7\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3059\nAccessibility Menu\nZoom In/Out\n100%\nText\nText Size\n100%\nLetter Spacing\nLine Height\nReadable Font\nColor\nInvert\nSaturation\nContrast\nAudio\nPage Reader\nAccessibility Assistance\nHighLight Keyboard Navigation\nOn-Screen Keyboard\nCursor\nOther\nHighlight Links\nTooltips\nPause Animations\nHide Images\nMotor Impaired\nColor Blind\nDyslexia\nVisually Impaired\nCognitive and Learning\nSeizure & Epileptic\nADHD\nmenu\n\t\tClose\nSearch\nOn 11 March 2011, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan shook the T\u014dhoku region, caused a chain of several additional disasters and claimed more than 15,000 lives.\nThough it is hard to forget such a devastating event, every year since, a growing collection of washi paper lanterns have been lit up as both a memorial for those that were affected by the disaster and as a display of hope for the future of the region.\nThe event will be lit up for the last time this March, marking the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.\nThe project began when students from Tama University traveled to the three disaster-stricken areas of T\u014dhoku in 2011 as part of their \u2018Japan Love Project\u2019. There, they gathered messages on hand-made Japanese paper and made them into lanterns. Every year since, more paper messages have been added to collection, which is then lit up at Tokyo Midtown\u2019s Lawn Square.\nThis year, the event theme is \u2018connecting\u2019, with the Washi Lantern Garden focusing on connecting the people affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the people from the rest of the country who cried out for those who suffered the unfortunate events. The event will also connect past memories, people and events with the blossoming future of the T\u014dhoku region.\nIf you are stuck at home, the event will be available to watch online, and each and every one of the messages collected over the last 10 years will be published via both instagram and twitter.\nApproximately 15,000 washi paper messages have been collected over the past 10 years, and 6,000 of them will be lit up at the Midtown Lawn Square.\nThis year, the lanterns will be set up in a pattern resembling five connected rings. In buddhist teachings, this pattern represents peace and harmony. You might also notice the pattern\u2019s nod to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.\nThe approach to the Tokyo Midtown Lawn Square will be illuminated by 4,500 of the washi paper lanterns.\nIf you look closely, you\u2019ll notice how the feelings of people who were living in the affected areas change with the passage of time \u2013 the older messages are full of pain, hurt and anger, whilst the more recent ones look towards a brighter and optimistic future for T\u014dhoku.\nWashi Paper Garden \u2013 TOHOKU 2021\nDates: 9 March \u2013 11 March, 2021\nTime: 17:00 \u2013 20:00\nLocation: Tokyo Midtown Garden, Lawn Square\nAdmission: Free\nFollow the event online, or via twitter and instagram\n*In case of rain or stormy weather, the event will be cancelled.\nBy - Connie Sceaphierde.",

Nick Mercurio said Tuesday. \u201cThe Space Force service dress uniform is still in development.\u201d\nThe news comes as something of a relief for the countless Twitter users who criticized the fake uniforms, likening them to a bad imitation of Star Trek uniforms mixed with cross-walk guards.\n\u201cThey stole the emblem logo from Star Trek. Then they stole the name from Guardians of the Galaxy. They then stole the uniform from Starship Troopers,\u201d wrote one user. \u201cNo original thought and no clear reason for the existence of this 5th branch of the military! It\u2019s a FARCE!\u201d\nOthers commented that the pretend uniforms are more reminiscent of Nazi Germany.\n\u201cWelp. No, crossing guards is not who they remind me of\u2026\u201d one user wrote.\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I did nazi that coming,\u201d wrote another.\nBut to those saying the uniforms resemble Hugo Boss designs, another user made a correction about the history between the fashion designer and the Nazi party.\n\u201cHugo Boss did not design Nazi uniforms, he did manufacture them, was a war profiteering Nazi scumbag who used forced labour, but he did not design the uniforms,\u201d the Fake History Hunter account tweeted.\nOthers criticized the existence of the Space Force altogether.\n\u201cPeople are starving and dying, but not to worry-we have Starship Trooper uniforms we\u2019ll never use!\u201d one user wrote.\nAt least when the Space Force releases their real uniform designs, the bar will have been set very low.\nFor more information on the Space Force, click here.

Hawn\u2019s shirt says \"Trump 2016.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse search of the image shows it to be doctored, and PolitiFact previously reported on this same photo in November 2018, rating it Pants on Fire.\nThe original photo was taken in September 2015, while the two actors were walking in Los Angeles, according to an article from PopSugar. The photo with that article, credited to Getty/Bauer-Griffin, shows Hawn wearing a blank shirt and Russell\u2019s shirt with just a small business logo.\nThe altered version previously surfaced on social media during Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Around the same time, another Facebook post falsely attributed a tweet praising Trump to Russell, and our reporters rated it Pants on Fire.\nA photo posted to Facebook shows Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn walking arm in arm wearing Trump t-shirts.

They were created under colonial and white minority rule policies that controlled movement, confined opportunity, and kept people apart.\nI grew up in a different historic black township in Zimbabwe, but Mbare was the first of its kind. It holds a unique place in the nation\u2019s imagination.\nMbare was originally named Harare. But in 1982 that name was reassigned to the capital city that houses it. In its storied past, it was once the heartbeat of black urban life. At its centre is Rufaro Stadium, where Bob Marley and the Wailers famously performed at Zimbabwe\u2019s independence celebrations.\nThe township was a hub of cultural energy, sports, and political activism, and the community beer hall served as a vital gathering point. Today, many of these beer halls stand derelict.\nThese once-thriving communal spaces reflect a broader neglect of civic infrastructure in post-independence Zimbabwe. Yet out of these ruins, new life is taking shape.\nOne of the most influential figures in Zimbabwe\u2019s artist-run spaces movement, Moffat Takadiwa, has transformed one of these former beer halls into the Mbare Art Space. The dynamic arts hub reclaims the building\u2019s original spirit of gathering, creativity and public engagement.\nOperating under a long lease from the Harare City Council, this nonprofit initiative is part of a wider urban renewal and adaptive reuse project aimed at reimagining the city\u2019s cultural infrastructure.\nMy ongoing work in archival research includes mapping and visiting historical and cultural spaces like this. Here Takadiwa saw the potential for not just studios and an exhibition venue, but also for dialogue and community regeneration.\nBeer halls were established by British colonial authorities in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) as part of a strategy of social control over the African urban population. They were designed to regulate leisure, restrict political organising and generate revenue through the sale of alcohol. By centralising drinking in state-run facilities, colonial administrators aimed to monitor and contain African social life while profiting from it.\nSituated in a repurposed colonial-era beer garden, Mbare Art Space turns a former site of segregation into a vibrant centre of artistic and communal revival. It redefines a legacy of constraint and control as one of creative freedom and empowerment. The place is now an artists\u2019 haven with studios, office space, an exhibition hall and a digital hub.\nTakadiwa\u2019s vision is informed by global precedents, notably inspired by US artist Theaster Gates, whose work includes the transformation of a derelict bank on Chicago\u2019s South Side. It became the Stony Island Arts Bank \u2013 a hybrid space for art, archives and community engagement.\nTakadiwa opened Mbare Art Space in 2019 with a vision to support emerging artists through mentorship and access to resources. True to his artistic philosophy \u2013 resurrecting abandoned, often overlooked materials suffering the effects of urban decay \u2013 he revitalised a neglected site. Most of the artists working from this space follow his lead, upcycling and recycling found materials into compelling visual forms that speak to both history and possibility.\nWhen I arrive, Takadiwa is on his way out, but offers me a quick tour of his studio, where works in progress for his upcoming participation in the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale are taking shape.\nKnown for his lush, densely layered sculptures and tapestry-like works made from found objects \u2013 computer keyboards, bottle tops, toothbrushes, and toothpaste tubes \u2013 Takadiwa has garnered international acclaim. His works are collected by US rapper Jay-Z and major institutions like the Centre National d\u2019Art Plastique in Paris, the European Parliament\u2019s art collection in Brussels, and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare.\nWhat Takadiwa is building is not just an arts centre \u2013 it\u2019s a new model space rooted in history and responsive to the present. The site itself becomes an ongoing installation, activated by the artists, curators and community members who inhabit it.\nTafadzwa Chimbumu, the operations manager, takes over the tour, guiding me through the rest of the precinct. The site retains the bones of its beer hall architecture, but it bursts with new life. Colourful murals adorn the walls. Tents draped over smaller buildings animate the exposed brickwork.\nPlans are underway to establish a library here, a resource where researchers and artists can engage with Zimbabwe\u2019s under-documented art history. Much of this history is scattered across archives and unpublished dissertations, rather than in widely available books. The aim is to bring these materials together and make them more accessible to the public.\nMbare Art Space is also becoming an exciting hub for collaboration and education. Community workshops, for example, are led by resident artists. Local schools take part in art education initiatives. Through community outreach and educational programming, the centre is extending its impact beyond its immediate geography.\nAs it looks to the future, Mbare Art Space is focused on expanding its artist-in-residence programme, inviting both local and international artists to immerse themselves in the context of Mbare and Zimbabwe.\nUltimately, what the space offers is something intangible \u2013 a feeling, a memory, a vision of what is possible when history and imagination meet in a shared place.\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132025, The Conversation",

        "article_texts": "### The Laos Villages Where People Build Homes Out of \u2026\nLaos is the most heavily bombed country per capita in history.\nUS warplanes dropped more than 270 million bombs on Laos during the Vietnam War, according to the National Regulation Authority (NRA), the governing body for mine action in Laos.\n\"On average, that's equal to a bombing mission every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, for nine years,\" Sarah Goring, a grants and public information manager at Mines Advisory Group (MAG), told Insider. MAG is a nonprofit organization that clears unexploded ordnance (UXO) from affected lands.\nUp to 30% of these bombs failed to detonate on impact, and they remain a deadly threat to local communities. Since 1964, more than 50,000 people have been killed or injured by UXO in Laos, per data from the NRA.\nThe bombing missions were part of the US Army's efforts to destroy enemy supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh trail.\nIf fighter pilots were unable to complete their original mission due to bad weather, they also used Laos as a dumping ground to offload bombs before returning to base.\nVillagers also use the unexploded bombs as scrap metal.\n\"The idea was to sell them for scrap metal because the price of scrap metal was high,\" Goring said of villagers who partook in the scrap metal trade. \"And again, if you've got no income, people took the risk.\"\nWhen the price of scrap metal had dropped significantly in 2008, MAG saw a massive reduction in accidents, she added.\n\"The UXOs were just another resource. They were everywhere, so we decided to make the most of what we have,\" La lok, a spoon-maker from the village of Ban Napia, told The Guardian.\nIn addition to mechanical and human failure, the weather played a role in keeping some of the bombs from exploding. During rainy seasons when the ground is wet, some of the bombs might have failed to explode due to a softer landing.\nMAG has an emergency hotline that villagers can call, but many people are used to clearing the bombs themselves.\n\"We would never encourage it, but I can understand,\" Goring said. \"What do you do? You find it in the middle of your paddy field that you might hit next year because you forget exactly where it is. So from their perspective, it's safer to move it to somewhere they're not farming.\"\n\"I met a woman a couple of years ago. She had an accident selling scrap to a trader. He tried to crack open the bomb, but it exploded and she lost her leg, and her son lost his eyesight,\" Goring said.\nIn 2021, there were 35 bomb-related accidents across Laos\u00a0involving 66 people \u2014 19 people were killed and 47 people were injured, she added, citing accident data.\nMAG destroys most of the bombs where they are, rather than moving them elsewhere.\nBefore clearance, the team conducts a survey of the area to locate as many bombs as possible. They evacuate people and animals from the surroundings before proceeding with the removal.\nThe UXOs continue to limit Lao's tourism industry, which could potentially be a strong driver for economic growth in the country.\nAlthough there is still much work to be done, villagers are hopeful for a better future.\n\"It was very difficult after the war and we had to use any resources we could, even bombs, but maybe that's starting to change. Maybe my children will be the last generation that have to work with the bombs,\" Seeonchan, a spoon-maker from Ban Napia, told The Guardian.\nHave an account? Log in\nUnlimited access.

Purported transcripts of those remarks were published by WikiLeaks weeks before the 2016 election.\nThe image in the meme, while it appears clipped straight from an old newspaper, is more than likely a cropped detail of a photograph taken at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump in 2005. Un-cropped versions of the photograph, easily surfaced in a quick Google Image search, show Bill Clinton and Melania Trump standing to Hillary\u2019s left.\nSeveral different media outlets, including CNN, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, and The Hollywood Reporter, have published similar images from that photo op and also confirmed that, yes, Bill and Hillary Clinton did attend the Trumps' wedding.\nWe rate the new variation of this claim as \"Miscaptioned\" because it applies a previously debunked, false back story to a real, though doctored, photograph. In other words, it\u2019s an old lie dressed up in new (black tie) clothing.\nHave you seen other variations of this claim?

Watson, a founder of modern genetics, landed in a kind of professional exile by suggesting that black people are intrinsically less intelligent than whites.\nIn 2007, Dr. Watson, who shared a 1962 Nobel Prize for describing the double-helix structure of DNA, told a British journalist that he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says, not really.\u201d\nMoreover, he added, although he wished everyone were equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with black employees find this not true.\u201d\nDr. Watson\u2019s comments reverberated around the world, and he was forced to retire from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, although he retains an office there.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe apologized publicly and \u201cunreservedly,\u201d and in later interviews he sometimes suggested that he had been playing the provocateur \u2014 his trademark role \u2014 or had not understood that his comments would be made public.\nEver since, Dr. Watson, 90, has been largely absent from the public eye. His speaking invitations evaporated.

In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper in Nature proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.[10] Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\nWatson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (Bachelor of Science, 1947) and Indiana University Bloomington (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology.\nFrom 1968, Watson served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming that there is a genetic link between intelligence and race. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book The Double Helix (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\nWatson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (n\u00e9e Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a businessman descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America.[11] His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of parents from County Tipperary, Ireland.[12] His mother was a modestly religious Catholic and his father an Episcopalian who had lost his belief in God.[13] Watson was raised Catholic, but he later described himself as \"an escapee from the Catholic religion\".[14] Watson said, \"The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didn't believe in God.\"[15] By age 11, Watson stopped attending mass and embraced the \"pursuit of scientific and humanistic knowledge.\"[13]\nWatson grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Elementary School and South Shore High School.[11][16] He was fascinated with bird watching, a hobby shared with his father,[17] so he considered majoring in ornithology.[18] Watson appeared on Quiz Kids, a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions.[19] Thanks to the liberal policy of university president Robert Hutchins, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of 15.[11][18][20] Among his professors was Louis Leon Thurstone from whom Watson learned about factor analysis, which he would later reference on his controversial views on race.[21]\nAfter reading Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book, What Is Life? in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics.[22] Watson earned his Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1947.[18] In his autobiography, Avoid Boring People, Watson described the University of Chicago as an \"idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth\", in contrast to his description of later experiences. In 1947, Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schr\u00f6dinger presented in his 1944 book.[23] He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Indiana University Bloomington in 1950; Salvador Luria was his doctoral advisor.[18][24]\nOriginally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of Salvador Luria. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, which concerned the nature of genetic mutations. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages. He and Max Delbr\u00fcck were among the leaders of this new \"Phage Group\", an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as Drosophila towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria's laboratory at Indiana University.[24] That spring, he met Delbr\u00fcck first in Luria's apartment and again that summer during Watson's first trip to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[25][26]\nThe Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene. In 1949, Watson took a course with Felix Haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves.[27] The other major molecular component of chromosomes, DNA, was widely considered to be a \"stupid tetranucleotide\", serving only a structural role to support the proteins.[28] Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment, which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson's research project involved using X-rays to inactivate bacterial viruses.[29]\nWatson then went to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar.[11] Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's.[30] After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maal\u00f8e, then a member of the Phage Group.[31]\nThe experiments\u2014which Watson became aware of at the previous summer\u2019s Cold Spring Harbor phage conference\u2014employed radioactive phosphate as a tracer to identify which molecular components of bacteriophage particles are responsible for infecting the host bacteria during viral entry.[30] The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbr\u00fcck,[30] they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA.[32] Watson never developed a constructive interaction with Kalckar, but he did accompany Kalckar to a meeting in Italy, where Watson saw Maurice Wilkins talk about X-ray diffraction data for DNA.[11] Watson had become firmly convinced that DNA possessed a distinct molecular structure amenable to precise elucidation.[33]\nIn 1951, the chemist Linus Pauling in California published his model of the amino acid alpha helix, a result that grew out of Pauling's efforts in X-ray crystallography and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research[34] conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the California Institute of Technology, Watson now had the desire to learn to perform X-ray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA. That summer, Luria met John Kendrew,[35] and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for Watson in England.[11] In 1951 Watson visited the Stazione Zoologica 'Anton Dohrn' in Naples.[36]\nIn mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA.[11] Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at King's College London\u2014mainly by Rosalind Franklin for whom they did not provide proper attribution.[37][38] Sir Lawrence Bragg,[39] the director of the Cavendish Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled \"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\" to the scientific journal Nature, which was published on April 25, 1953.[40] Bragg gave a talk at the Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by Ritchie Calder in the London newspaper News Chronicle, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\".\nSydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University's chemistry department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.[41]\nThe Cambridge University student newspaper Varsity ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids.[11][42][43] Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for nomination.[37] The publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science; understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.[44]\nWatson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling has attracted scrutiny. It has been argued that Watson and his colleagues did not properly acknowledge colleague Rosalind Franklin for her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure.[38][45] Robert P. Crease notes that \"Such stingy behaviour may not be unknown, or even uncommon, among scientists\".[46] Franklin's high-quality X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA were unpublished results, which Watson and Crick used without her knowledge or consent in their construction of the double helix model of DNA.[45][37][47] Franklin's results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.[23] Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel.\nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data:\nIn a 1954 article, Watson and Crick acknowledged that, without Franklin's data, \"the formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible\".[51] In The Double Helix, Watson later admitted that \"Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data. For that matter, no one at King's realized they were in our hands\". In recent years, Watson has garnered controversy in the popular and scientific press for his \"misogynist treatment\" of Franklin and his failure to properly attribute her work on DNA. In recent years, Watson has attracted significant controversy in both the popular and scientific communities for the reportedly dismissive manner in which he depicted Rosalind Franklin, as well as for his insufficient acknowledgment of her substantive contributions to DNA research.[38] According to one critic, Watson's portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix was negative, giving the impression that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data.[52] Watson's accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside.[23] From a 2003 piece by Brenda Maddox in Nature:[38]\nOther comments dismissive of \"Rosy\" in Watson's book caught the attention of the emerging women's movement in the late 1960s. \"Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place ... Unfortunately Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot\". And, \"Certainly a bad way to go out into the foulness of a ... November night was to be told by a woman to refrain from venturing an opinion about a subject for which you were not trained.\"\nRobert P. Crease remarks that \"[Franklin] was close to figuring out the structure of DNA, but did not do it. The title of 'discoverer' goes to those who first fit the pieces together\".[46] Jeremy Bernstein rejects that Franklin was a \"victim\" and states that \"[Watson and Crick] made the double-helix scheme work. It is as simple as that\".[46] Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel C. Comfort write that \"Franklin was no victim in how the DNA double helix was solved\" but that she was \"an equal contributor to the solution of the structure\".[51]\nA review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters were framed with the normal and unremarkable forms of address, beginning with \"Dear Jim\", and concluding with \"Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind\". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of Nature. These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J. D. and Crick F. H. C. \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\". Nature 171, 737\u2013738 (1953);[40] Wilkins M. H. F., Stokes A. R. & Wilson H. R. \"Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids\". Nature 171, 738\u2013740 (1953);[53] Franklin R. and Gosling R. G. \"Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate\". Nature 171, 740\u2013741 (1953).[54]\nIn 1956, Watson accepted a position in the biology department at Harvard University. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.[55]\nWatson championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology, stating that disciplines such as ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings, going so far as to discourage their study by students.\nWatson continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968.[55]\nDuring his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the Vietnam War, leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for \"the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam\".[56] In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President Gerald Ford, arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.[57]\nWatson's first textbook, The Molecular Biology of the Gene, used the concept of heads\u2014brief declarative subheadings.[58] His next textbook was Molecular Biology of the Cell, in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third was Recombinant DNA, which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought new information about how organisms function.\nIn 1968, Watson wrote The Double Helix,[59] listed by the board of the Modern Library as number seven in their list of 100 Best Nonfiction books.[60] The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson's original title was to have been \"Honest Jim\".[61] Controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson's book was originally to be published by the Harvard University Press, but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, among others, objected. Watson's home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published.[62][63] In an interview with Anne Sayre for her book, Rosalind Franklin and DNA (published in 1975 and reissued in 2000), Francis Crick said that he regarded Watson's book as a \"contemptible pack of damned nonsense\".[64]\nIn 1968, Watson was appointed director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Their two sons were born between 1970 and 1972, and by 1974, the family had established a permanent residence in Cold Spring Harbor. Watson led the laboratory as director and president for approximately 35 years, subsequently serving as its chancellor and, later, chancellor emeritus.\nIn his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, \"dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering.\"[65] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson's direction. He is credited with \"transforming a small facility into one of the world's great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer.\"[66] In a retrospective summary of Watson's accomplishments there, Bruce Stillman, the laboratory's president, said, \"Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science.\"[66]\nIn 2007, Watson said, \"I turned against the left wing because they don't like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.\"[67]\nIn 1990, Watson was appointed as the head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992.[68] Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, Bernadine Healy. Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the \"laws of nature\". Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, \"The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations.\" He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs.[69] (The issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the US by the US Supreme Court; see Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.)\nIn 1994, Watson became president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Francis Collins took over the role as director of the Human Genome Project.\nWatson was quoted in The Sunday Telegraph in 1997 as stating: \"If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn't want a homosexual child, well, let her.\"[70] The biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a letter to The Independent claiming that Watson's position was misrepresented by The Sunday Telegraph article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasise that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.[71]\nOn the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: \"Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them.\"[72]\nWatson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the \"really stupid\" bottom 10% of people should be cured.[73] He has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered, saying in 2003, \"People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.\"[73][74]\nIn 2007, Watson became the second person[75] to publish his fully sequenced genome online,[76] after it was presented to him on May 31, 2007, by 454 Life Sciences Corporation[77] in collaboration with scientists at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Watson was quoted as saying, \"I am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine, in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies\".[78][79][80]\nIn 2014, Watson published a paper in The Lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that The Lancet published Watson's paper only because of his name.[81] Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.[82]\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel Prize medal to raise money after complaining of being made an \"unperson\" following controversial statements he had made.[83] Part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research.[84] The medal sold at auction at Christie's in December 2014 for US$4.1 million. Watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in Long Island and to funding research at Trinity College, Dublin.[85][86] He was the first living Nobel recipient to auction a medal.[87] The medal was later returned to Watson by the purchaser, Alisher Usmanov.[88]\nSeveral of Watson's former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, Mario Capecchi,[3] Bob Horvitz, Peter B. Moore and Joan Steitz.[4] Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral researchers and other interns including Ewan Birney,[5] Ronald W. Davis, Phillip Allen Sharp (postdoc), John Tooze (postdoc)[7][8] and Richard J. Roberts (postdoc).[6]\nWatson is a former member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by Chang Yi Wang. He held the position for six years and retired from the board in 1999.[89]\nIn January 2007, Watson accepted the invitation of Leonor Beleza, president of the Champalimaud Foundation, to become the head of the foundation's scientific council, an advisory organ.[90][91]\nIn March 2017, Watson was named head consultant of the Cheerland Investment Group, a Chinese investment company which sponsored his trip.[92]\nWatson has been an institute adviser for the Allen Institute for Brain Science.[93][94]\nWatson has had disagreements with Craig Venter regarding his use of EST fragments while Venter worked at National Institutes of Health. Venter went on to found Celera genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter \"Hitler\".[95]\nIn his 2007 memoir, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, Watson describes his academic colleagues as \"dinosaurs\", \"deadbeats\", \"fossils\", \"has-beens\", \"mediocre\", and \"vapid\".[96] Steve Shapin in Harvard Magazine noted that Watson had written an unlikely \"Book of Manners\", telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist's career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E. O. Wilson once described Watson as \"the most unpleasant human being I had ever met\", but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard \"old history\" (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).[97][98]\nIn the epilogue to the memoir Avoid Boring People, Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president Lawrence Summers, who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science.[99] Watson also states in the epilogue, \"Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated.\"[74][96]\nAt a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos.[72][100] His lecture argued that extracts of melanin\u2014which gives skin its color\u2014had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. \"That's why you have Latin lovers\", he said, according to people who attended the lecture. \"You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient.\"[101] He has also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity, and Indians being servile because of selection under caste endogamy.[102] Regarding intelligence differences between blacks and whites, Watson has asserted that \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their (blacks) intelligence is the same as ours (whites) \u2013 whereas all the testing says not really\u00a0... people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.\"[103]\nWatson has repeatedly asserted that differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetics.[104][105][106] In early October 2007, he was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). He discussed his view that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners.[107][108][109] Watson said his intention was to promote science, not racism, but some UK venues canceled his appearances,[110] and he canceled the rest of his tour.[111][112][113][114] An editorial in Nature said that his remarks were \"beyond the pale\" but expressed a wish that the tour had not been canceled so that Watson would have had to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.[115] Because of the controversy, the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson's administrative responsibilities.[116] Watson issued an apology,[117] then retired at the age of 79 from CSHL from what the lab called \"nearly 40 years of distinguished service\".[66][118] Watson attributed his retirement to his age and to circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired.[119][120][121]\nIn 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL[122][123] but continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory.[124] In a BBC documentary that year, Watson said he did not see himself as a racist.[125]\nIn January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary made the previous year in which he repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to Watson and cut all remaining ties with him.[126][127][128] Watson did not respond to the developments.[129]\nWatson is an atheist.[15][130] In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[131] Watson wrote in Time that he contributed $1,000 to Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.[13]\nWatson married Elizabeth Lewis in 1968.[9] They have two sons, Rufus Robert Watson (b. 1970) and Duncan James Watson (b. 1972). Watson sometimes talks about his son Rufus, who has schizophrenia, seeking to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contributes to it.[124]\nWatson has won numerous awards, including:\n\"All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" --\"Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies\".

Because real news is depressing as f************ck.\nThe gun sale is real, and riddled with controversy. \u00a0The first gun-auction site quickly\u00a0pulled Zimmerman's listing. \u00a0The second\u00a0site had to temporarily take down the page\u00a0after troll accounts crashed its servers.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Kendrick Lamar's 2013 Concert History - Concert Archives\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper.

For decades, the cement plant was an important source of employment, both direct and indirect, several generations of \" Vicentinos \" have worked in it, and it significantly boosted the economy of the town, and also, due to the proximity of Alicante capital, there was a notorious population emigration { coming above all from Murcia, Castilla-La Mancha and Andalucia }.\nAlthough today it remains closed and abandoned, it is a complex that, beyond its industrial/functional value, has become a piece of historical heritage that deserves to be protected, known and valued. Several of its industrial pieces have great historical and typological value, recognized by prestigious specialists in the field of industrial architecture such as Inmaculada Aguilar Civera. The complex has even been proposed for inclusion in the catalog of industrial architecture of modernity in Spain { DOCOMOMO }. Currently six of its buildings are protected in the Catalog of Protected Assets and Spaces approved by the Ministry of Culture.\nSince the beginning of the 2000s, groups of residents of San Vicent del Raspeig, together with environmental groups and regional political parties, have been demanding that the City Council cease the activity of the Cemex cement company, dedicated to the manufacture of white cement and located in an environment each closer to the urban area due to the expansion of the municipality. The University of Alicante was in charge of several studies that demonstrated a high atmospheric pollution due to the activity of the cement factory. In 2008, Greenpeace included in a study entitled Pollution in Spain, that the San Vicent cement plant is the industry that polluted the most in the province of Alicante. Until 2008, only protocols of intent had been signed, which entailed a series of restrictions to be complied with by the multinational and to initiate the definitive cessation of the factory. Finally, the Ministry of the Environment announced that the final date for the closure would be August 1, 2009.\nIn the year 2022, the Governing Boar of the San Vicent City Council has dismissed the allegations and has denied the works permit presented by Cemex to demolish, recover equipment and dismantle buildings of the old cement factory.\n\n### The Factory / Ricardo Bofill - ArchDaily\nIf you want to make the best of your experience on our site, sign-up.\nIf you want to make the best of your experience on our site, sign-up.\nProjects\nImages\nProducts\nFolders\nSubscription\nBenefits\nArchive\nContent\nMaps\nAudio\n+ 35\nHolcim\nFontana Showers\nImpact Acoustic\nUSG\nFlannery Inc.\nGaggenau\nBANDALUX\nAlcon Lighting\u00ae\nAGROB BUCHTAL\nStudco\nTecnografica\nVectorworks",

Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign arm began reaching out to the former staff members to help make travel arrangements and intends to pay for air travel and hotel expenses, the people said.\nMr. Sanders plans to attend a portion of the meeting.\nThe steps Mr. Sanders and his supporters have taken over the last week underscore the sense of urgency the senator faces as he prepares for a likely 2020 campaign. Though he has not yet announced that he intends to run, he has told aides and advisers that a decision is coming soon.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn the last two weeks, The New York Times and Politico have published reports with accounts of harassment and discrimination from former workers in Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. Mr. Sanders has twice apologized publicly to women who were mistreated, and promised to do better if he runs again.\nThe allegations have also contributed to a shakeup of Mr. Sanders\u2019s core group of advisers. Should he run again in 2020, three top aides from the 2016 campaign either will not return or will serve in different roles, according to people close to Mr. Sanders. One of those advisers is Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager, who has said he would not return in the same role if Mr. Sanders runs again.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nADVERTISEMENT\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\nSee subscription options\nMake sense of the day\u2019s news and ideas.\nCatch up on big news, and wind down to end your day.\nThe biggest stories of our time, in 20 minutes a day.\nGet what you need to know to start your day.\nOriginal analysis on the week\u2019s biggest global stories.\nThe latest news for any part of the world you select.\nBackstories and analysis from our Canadian correspondents.\nThe most crucial business and policy news you need to know.\nOur best tech reporting from the week.\nOur tech journalists help you make sense of the rapidly changing tech world.\nReviews, news and features to help you find your next read.\nStreaming TV and movie recommendations.\nThe podcast that takes you inside the literary world.\nPop music news, new songs and albums, and artists of note.\nUnwind with stories about culture and the way we live.\nEssential news and guidance to live your healthiest life.\nThe complicated love lives of real people.\nMapping the new world order through interviews and conversations.\nYou've heard the news, here's what to make of it.\nDiscussions of ideas that matter, plus book recommendations.\nPodcasts and narrated articles covering news, tech, culture and more.Go to Audio\nCome on in, the culture's fine.\nYour morning listen.

It helped propel him to a strong second in the 2016 Democratic primary campaign and has returned as the marquee message for his 2020 campaign, which he announced on Tuesday with a promise to \u201ccomplete that revolution.\u201d\nUnfortunately for his 2020 campaign, Sanders is less distinct on economic policy than he was in 2016. His rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have either embraced broad ideas like Medicare for all or unveiled their own: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s universal child care proposal; Cory Booker\u2019s plan to drastically reduce housing costs; Kamala Harris\u2019s LIFT Act, which would build on the earned-income tax credit and create a new monthly cash payment for most middle-class households.\nBut Sanders isn\u2019t without an advantage. If in 2016 his foreign-policy thinking was underbaked, then in 2019 he stands as one of the few candidates with a fully formed vision for American foreign policy. It\u2019s one that ties his domestic focus on political and economic justice to a larger project of international cooperation and solidarity, anti-authoritarianism and promotion of democratic values. It\u2019s a vision that rests on the conviction that progressive politics must continue past the water\u2019s edge.\nSanders articulated the substance of his foreign policy views in two speeches: one in 2017 at Missouri\u2019s Westminster College \u2014 speaking from the stage where Winston Churchill delivered his \u201cIron Curtain\u201d speech \u2014 and one last October at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn his Johns Hopkins address, Sanders offered a big-picture reading of this moment in international relations. For him, the ideological struggle of the 21st century doesn\u2019t pit a liberal, democratic America against illiberal, authoritarian opponents, but instead pits liberal, democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad. It\u2019s a \u201cworldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy\u201d against one toward \u201cstrengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\u201d In this conception of the world, President Trump is just one of many \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d\nThese movements don\u2019t emerge out of nothing. Sanders contends that they are fueled by the enormous disparities of wealth and opportunity that define global capitalism. This is the subject of his Westminster College speech \u2014 an attempt to link domestic economic issues to relations among states. \u201cThis planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much, and so many have so little \u2014 and when we advance day after day into an oligarchic form of society where a small number of extraordinarily powerful special interests exert enormous influence over the economic and political life of the world,\u201d Sanders said, adding later that \u201cinequality, corruption, oligarchy and authoritarianism are inseparable.\u201d\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nJamelle Bouie became a New York Times Opinion columnist in 2019.

The 82-year-old, from Vermont, announced Monday, May 6, that he\u2019s seeking his fourth term in the U.S. Senate. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced Monday he will run for reelection this year, squelching speculation that the 82-year-old progressive icon might retire at a time when the Democratic Party is anxious about the advancing age of its top leaders.\nHailing from a Democratic stronghold, Sanders\u2019 decision virtually guarantees that he will return to Washington for a fourth Senate term. And his announcement comes at a critical moment for Democrats as the party navigates a growing divide over Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza.\nSanders has criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S. relationship with Israel even as he\u2019s hailed much of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda ahead of what could be a tough reelection fight for Biden against presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\nSanders said he wants the war in Gaza ended immediately, massive humanitarian aid to follow and no more money sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\u201cWe are living in a complicated and difficult political moment,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press on Monday. \u201cI very strongly disagree with Biden in terms of the war in Gaza.\u201d\nAt home, he said, the presidential election is between Biden and Trump, \u201cand Donald Trump is in my view the most dangerous president, has been the most dangerous president in American history.\u201d\nWith the prospect of Trump\u2019s possible return to the White House, Sanders framed his bid to return to the Senate as being driven by concerns about the future of democracy in the U.S. In an announcement video, he said that in many ways the 2024 election \u201cis the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\u201d\n\u201cWill the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?\u201d he said. He questioned whether the country will reverse what he called \u201cthe unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality\u201d and if it can create a government that works for all, and not continue with a political system dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.\nKnown for his liberal politics and crusty demeanor, Sanders has been famously consistent over his 40 years in politics, championing better health care paid for by the government, higher taxes for the wealthy, less military intervention and major solutions for climate change. He has also spent his career trying to hold corporate executives to account, something that he\u2019s had more power to do as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\nSanders is an independent. He was a Democratic congressman for 16 years and still caucuses with the Democrats.\nHe sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. He said a year ago that he would forgo another presidential bid and endorse Biden\u2019s reelection this year.\n\u201cI have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times,\u201d Sanders said in a review of his positions as chairman of the important Senate panel and a member of the chamber\u2019s Democratic leadership team, as well as a senior member of various other committees.\n___\nAP writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed from Washington.\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "article_texts": "### Clyde Arc - Wikipedia\nThe Clyde Arc (known locally as the Squinty Bridge) is a road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland, connecting Finnieston near the SEC Armadillo and SEC with Pacific Quay and Glasgow Science Centre in Govan. Prominent features of the bridge are its innovative curved design, and that it crosses the river at an angle. The Arc is the first city centre traffic crossing over the river built since the Kingston Bridge was opened to traffic in 1970.\nThe bridge was named the \"Clyde Arc\" upon its official opening on 18 September 2006. It had been previously known as the \"Finnieston Bridge\", or the \"Squinty Bridge\".[1]\nThe Clyde Arc was designed by Halcrow Group and built by BAM Nuttall. Glasgow City Council instigated the project in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government. Piling works for the bridge were carried out from a large floating barge on the Clyde, whilst the bridge superstructure was fabricated offsite. The bridge-deck concrete-slab units were cast at an onsite pre-casting yard. Planning permission was granted in 2003 and construction of the bridge began in May 2005. It was structurally completed in April 2006. The bridge project cost an estimated \u00a320.3M[2] and is designed to last 120 years.[3]\nThe bridge has a main span of 96\u00a0m (315\u00a0ft) with two end spans of 36.5\u00a0m (120\u00a0ft), resulting in a total span of 169\u00a0m (554\u00a0ft). The design of the main span features a steel arch. The supports for the main span are located within the river with the abutments located behind the existing quay walls. The central navigation height at mean water height is 5.4\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft).\nIt was officially opened on 18 September 2006 by Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell, although pedestrians were allowed to walk across it the previous two days as part of Glasgow's annual \"Doors Open\" Weekend.\nThe bridge connects Finnieston Street on the north bank of the river to Govan Road on the southern bank. The bridge takes four lanes of traffic, two of which are dedicated to public transport and two for private and commercial traffic. There are also pedestrian and cycle paths. The new bridge was built to provide better access to Pacific Quay and allow better access to regeneration areas on both banks of the Clyde. The bridge has been designed to cope with a possible light rapid transit system (light railway scheme) or even a tram system.\nThe bridge is the first part of several development projects planned to regenerate Glasgow. The \u00a340M Tradeston Bridge was also completed (a further proposed pedestrian bridge linking Springfield Quay with Lancefield Quay was not). The canting basin and Govan Graving Docks next to Pacific Quay are subject to development along with Tradeston and Laurieston. A derelict area of Dalmarnock was used as the 'athletes' village' for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.[4]\nThe bridge was closed between 14 January and 28 June 2008 due to the failure of one support hanger, and cracks found in a second.\nOn the night of 14 January 2008 the connecting fork on one of the bridge's 14 hangers (supporting cables that transfer the weight of the roadway to the bridge's arch) snapped; Strathclyde Police quickly closed the bridge to traffic.[5] Robert Booth, a spokesman for Glasgow City Council said:\nWe don't believe the integrity of the bridge is affected. The Clyde Arc is designed to allow for the removal of one of the bridge supports at a time for repair and maintenance without affecting its operation. However, our number one priority is public safety and until we are completely satisfied the bridge is safe to use, it will remain closed.\nA detailed inspection on 24 January found a stress fracture in a second support cable stay, like the one which had failed previously. Engineers determined that all of these connectors would have to be replaced; rather than a brief closure the bridge would have to remain closed for six months.[6] In addition traffic on the river below was also halted.[7] In March Nuttall began installing five temporary saddle frames atop the bridge's arch; these allowed the weight of the bridge to be supported without the hangers. This allowed them to replace defective fork connectors at the top and bottom of each hanger.[6]\nThe bridge recommenced on 28 June 2008 with just two of its four lanes in use, having had all the cast steel connectors replaced with milled steel connectors.[8] Once reopened, Glasgow City Council estimated that 6,500 crossings will be made every day using the bridge.[9]\nNew Civil Engineer reported subcontractor Watson Steel Structures was suing Macalloy, the supplier of the failed connectors, for \u00a31.8 million. Watson alleged components obtained from Macalloy did not meet British Standards or their own specifications; parts were inadequately manufactured, and did not tally with test certificates provided by the firm. Macalloy denied the claim and countered Watson Steel Structures Ltd had only specified minimum yield stress for the components.[10][11][12]\n\n### A guide to the 16 incredible bridges that span the \u2026\nAs the old maxim goes, Glasgow made the Clyde and the Clyde made Glasgow. The city was born on the great river's banks, and it continues to flourish because of it.\nBut in order for Glasgow to expand and cover both sides of the Clyde, local engineers needed to figure out how to bridge the gap.\nGlasgow's first bridge over the Clyde was a wooden structure completed in the late 13th century and it linked the Barony of the Gorbals with the city. The Old Glasgow Bridge would remain the city's only Clyde crossing until 1771 with the completion of a second bridge at Jamaica Street.\nREAD MORE: Six of the best Glasgow urban explorer videos we've seen so far\nIn the intervening 250 years, well over a dozen new bridges have been constructed in central Glasgow between the mouth of the River Kelvin in the west and Dalmarnock in the east.\nFrom St Andrew's Suspension Bridge and Central Station's Caledonian railway bridge to newer constructions such as the Kingston Bridge motorway crossing and the 'Squinty' bridge, each of these feats of engineering has its own fascinating story to tell.\nGiven there is a sign on its northern extent informing drivers they are leaving Glasgow, Rutherglen Bridge, or Shawfield Bridge as it's sometimes known, feels like a perfect place to start our journey.\nCrossing the Clyde immediately east of Glasgow Green, Rutherglen Glen was completed in 1896 to connect Shawfield and Oatlands with Glasgow's East End. An earlier bridge on the site, completed in 1776 and designed by James Watt, gave the nearby area of Bridgeton its name.\nRutherglen Bridge is comprised of three arches and is made from grey granite.\nMany of Glasgow's bridges have gone through several iterations, and Polmadie Bridge is a perfect example of this. Completed in 1901 the earliest bridge here was wooden but succumbed to fire in the 1920s. It was replaced with a concrete structure in the 1950s.\nThe concrete version of the bridge was found to be unsafe and demolished in 2015, and has since been replaced by a new Polmadie Bridge catering for cyclists and pedestrians which opened in August 2018.\nLinking Hutchesontown with Glasgow Green, the original King's Bridge was finished in 1901 to a wooden design that opened on the same day as the Polmadie Bridge immediately east of here. Now carrying the A74, today's incarnation dates from the 1930s and is far wider and more robust than its predecessor.\nNow on to a bridge that is arguably the city's most handsome. A Glasgow Green icon, the St Andrew's Suspension Bridge dates from 1856 and was built to replace an earlier ferry carrying workers between Calton and Bridgeton. It is painted in dominant blue to reflect the link with Scotland's patron saint.\nNamed after the beloved husband of Queen Victoria, Albert Bridge was finished in 1871 and, rather incredibly, is the fifth bridge to have spanned this section of the Clyde. The first, known as the Hutcheson Bridge, was built in 1794, but was destroyed by flooding.\nRobert Stevenson, the famous lighthouse builder and grandfather of author Robert Louis Stevenson, was responsible for the Albert Bridge's stone-built predecessor, which had only stood for 34 years when it was demolished in 1868.\nThe piers of this highly-decorative bridge are topped with ornate street lanterns, making this one of the most beautiful bridges on our list.\nOpened in 1899, this one's a real feat of engineering. The current incarnation replaced an earlier bridge built by the City of Glasgow Union Railway which opened in 1870 and was Glasgow's first railway crossing over the River Clyde.\nNow a freight crossing, the rebuilt City Union Bridge carried passenger traffic until 1966 when St Enoch Station closed. Should the Glasgow Crossrail project go ahead, the bridge will once again carry passenger services.\nGlasgow's bridges don't come much more historic than the Victoria Bridge.\nConnecting Clyde Street and Gorbals Street, the bridge is the oldest-surviving in the city and was built on the site of Glasgow's very first Clyde crossing. Built in the late 13th century out of timber, that first bridge was replaced in 1345 by the Bishop's Bridge, which managed to last for an astonishing 500 years.\nNamed in tribute to Queen Victoria, the Victoria Bridge was opened in 1854 and was the second widest bridge in Britain at the time of its construction.\nSign up to our Glasgow Live nostalgia newsletters for more local history and heritage content straight to your inbox.\nSimilar in style to the St Andrew's Suspension Bridge located further upstream, the South Portland Street crossing provides a helpful link between the city centre and the Gorbals and Laurieston districts.\nIt was built in 1853, replacing a temporary wooden structure designed by the aforementioned lighthouse engineer Robert Stevenson.\nCommonly referred to by locals as the Jamaica Street Bridge, Glasgow Bridge was completed in 1899 and, to complicate matters further, was formerly known as Broomielaw Bridge.\nThe current incarnation was constructed on the site of the original bridge completed in 1772 to the designs of William Mylne and civil engineer John Smeaton. This in turn was replaced in 1836 by a seven-arch stone bridge designed by the esteemed engineer Thomas Telford. Much of Telford's stonework has been incorporated into the present-day design.\nThe Caledonian Railway Company built their first bridge over this section of the Clyde in 1878 but decided to rebuild the crossing just 20 years later during the expansion of Central Station. The current bridge dates from 1905, and is believed to have been the widest railway bridge in the world at the time of its construction. The piers of the original Caledonian Bridge are still standing on the eastern edge of the 1905 crossing.\nLinking the city centre and Tradeston, the King George V Bridge was originally intended to be built in 1914 but had its construction delayed due to the First World War. It was eventually completed in 1928 and named for King George V.\nAffectionately known by locals as the 'squiggly bridge' on account of its distinctive bend, the Tradeston Bridge is one of the newest of Glasgow's Clyde crossings having been completed in 2009. The bridge is designated for pedestrians and cyclists only.\nA marvel of 20th century engineering, the Kingston Bridge is where the M8 Motorway meets the River Clyde and is famous as being one of the busiest bridges in Europe, carrying an estimated 150,000 vehicles every day.\nTaking its name from the old Kingston Dock, the Kingston Bridge was first planned in 1945 as part of Glasgow's inner ring road scheme. It was eventually opened in June 1970 at a cost of \u00a32.4 million.\nContinuing the theme of Glasgow bridges being given a more descriptive unofficial name by locals, the Clyde Arc, colloquially known as the 'squinty bridge', connects the Scottish Exhibition campus at Finnieston with Pacific Quay on the other side of the Clyde.\nNow a veritable city icon that is often lit up to mark major events and special occasions, the bridge opened in 2006 and was Glasgow's first city centre road bridge over the Clyde since the Kingston Bridge 36 years earlier.\nCompleted in 1988, Bell's Bridge is a swing bridge catering for pedestrians and is one of the few architectural vestiges of the Glasgow Garden Festival. It remains the most direct pedestrian crossing between the SEC Armadillo and Pacific Quay.\nThe bridge was made possible by the mass closure of shipyards in the years leading up to its construction. The absence of tall ships venturing this far up the Clyde no longer prevented bridges being built west of Anderston.\nAs the last of Glasgow's Clyde crossings, the Millennium Bridge may not be much of a looker, but it does look rather brilliant when it opens up to allow shipping to pass. The pedestrian link was completed in 2002, with the next nearest Clyde bridge west of here being the Erskine Bridge situated nine miles away.\nREAD NEXT:\nAmazing Glasgow footage captures expat's nostalgic return to city in 1987\nGlasgow's great department stores of yesteryear that are gone but not forgotten\nStunning aerial photos of Glasgow show how city has changed over 100 years\nNine Glasgow shops that have been around so long it defies all logic\nGlasgow author lifts lid on historic air show that attracted huge crowds in 1910",

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nBradley Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable update of the love story doomed by shifting fame\nI\nt\u2019s the romantic epic of male sacrificial woundedness and it\u2019s been regenerating like Doctor Who. We had it in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, in 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason and originally way back in 1937 with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. It\u2019s even been regenerating obliquely in movies such as The Artist and La La Land. Now Bradley Cooper plays the boozy and downwardly mobile alpha-star laying his pride on the showbiz altar of the woman he loves. Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable and colossally enjoyable new version, supercharged with dilithium crystals of pure melodrama. He appears opposite a sensationally good Lady Gaga, whose ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level at all times.\nHere is the heart-wrenching gallantry of the grumpy, drunken singing star teetering over the apex of his fame, who discovers a talented young woman \u2013 single-handedly launching her on a glorious career while his own spirals downwards, redeeming his own former arrogance with this magnificently selfless act. He must accept the fate of being the embarrassing loser and has-been, finally not even allowed to be the wind beneath her wings.\nCooper and veteran screenwriter Eric Roth are clearly inspired most directly by the Streisand/Kristofferson film. But in those closeups that Cooper awards himself, and his huge moments of emotional agony \u2026 well, he\u2019s channelling a bit of Judy. He certainly de-machos the role, and creates a backstory of vulnerability. Yet the crunch question is: how are Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper going to reinvent that terrifying award-ceremony scene, when he embarrasses her publicly? Well, the climax of their ordeal is bigger than I ever thought possible. It\u2019s the final station of the cross.\nCooper takes his voice down a couple of octaves to play Jackson Maine, a gravel-toned MOR country-rocker doing stadium tours and keeping it together with huge amounts of booze and pills. He\u2019s still a big success, but personally and emotionally he\u2019s running on empty. (Cooper actually co-writes a few of his songs here, and his band is played by Neil Young\u2019s longtime backing group: Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real.) He\u2019s also suffering from encroaching deafness and tinnitus, which periodically bring him close to anxiety attacks and temper tantrums. He has to be shepherded by his manager and older brother, Bobby, played by Sam Elliott, for whom he has longstanding feelings of resentment, rivalry and guilt.\nOut of booze after a show one night, Jackson has his driver pull over when he spots what turns out to be a drag bar, where the boss lets a woman sing in non-drag: this is the extraordinarily talented Ally (Lady Gaga), who socks over a killer version of La Vie En Rose. Jackson is stunned, as well he might be. They have an adventure together and Ally\u2019s unimpressed attitude to celebrity and her vocational attitude to music entrances Jackson. He falls deeply in love, even showing up at the family home, where she mortifyingly still lives with her dad, played by Andrew Dice Clay. Jackson finally gets her up on stage with him for a duet, and her greatness is obvious, but a dark shadow falls when she is approached by creepy Brit talent manager Rez (Rafi Gavron), under whose tutelage Ally seriously blows up. She is writer, singer, dancer and sex bomb. Poor Jackson is fame 1.0 and he realises Ally is fame 2.0, and the crunch comes when he is humiliatingly bumped from a promised opening slot at the Grammys, singing a tribute cover to Roy Orbison \u2013 of all the tellingly obsolete bygone stars. Ally, meanwhile, is up for three awards that very same evening.\nCooper is arguably prettier than Lady Gaga, but she is the one who commands your attention: that sharp, quizzical, leonine, mesmeric face \u2013 an uningratiating face, very different from the wide-eyed openness of Streisand or Garland. (Weirdly, she rather more resembles Marta Heflin, playing the groupie-slash-interviewer who went to bed with Kristofferson in \u201976.) Her songs are gorgeous and the ingenuous openness of her scenes with Jackson are wonderfully sympathetic. Meanwhile Cooper, whose screen persona can so often be bland and unchallenging, makes precisely this conservative tendency work for him in the role. He is so sad you want to hug him. Arguably, this film fudges some of Jackson\u2019s dark side, by giving him partial deafness as well as alcoholism, but it is still a richly sympathetic spectacle.\nFor all that it\u2019s hokum, this film alludes tactlessly to something pretty real. It could be called: A Star Is Dying. The new generation supplants the existing one. For one star to get an award, a handful of defeated nominees have to swallow their pain, as the spotlight moves away from them. For one star to deliver the shock of the new, another one has to receive the shock of the old. A Star Is Born turns that transaction into a love story.\nA Star is Born has premiered at the Venice film festival and is released in the UK and US on 5 October\n\n### A Star Is Born (2018 film) - Wikipedia\nA Star Is Born is a 2018 American musical romantic drama produced and directed by Bradley Cooper (in his directorial debut) with a screenplay by Cooper, Eric Roth and Will Fetters. It stars Cooper and Lady Gaga in lead roles, with Dave Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Elliott in supporting roles. It follows an alcoholic musician (Cooper) who discovers and falls in love with a young singer (Gaga). It is the fourth American movie made of the story, after the original 1937 romantic drama and its 1954 and 1976 remakes. Principal photography began at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2017.\nA Star Is Born premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 5, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It emerged as a major critical and commercial success, grossing over $436\u00a0million worldwide and receiving widespread critical acclaim for Cooper, Gaga, and Elliott's performances and Cooper's direction, as well as the screenplay, cinematography, and soundtrack. The film received numerous accolades, including eight nominations for the 91st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Cooper), Best Actress (Gaga) and Best Supporting Actor (Elliott); it won Best Original Song for \"Shallow\". It also earned five nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, and won Best Original Song for \"Shallow\".\nThe film's soundtrack received a BAFTA Award and four Grammy Award wins out of seven nominations, including nominations for Song of the Year two years in a row. For her acting and soundtrack contributions on A Star Is Born, Gaga became the first woman in history to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award and Grammy Award in one single year.\nForty-three-year-old Jackson \"Jack\" Maine, a country rock singer privately battling an alcohol and drug addiction, plays at a concert. His primary support is Bobby, his manager and older half-brother. After a show, Jack goes out for drinks and visits a drag bar where he witnesses a tribute performance to \u00c9dith Piaf by 31-year-old Ally, who works as a waitress and singer-songwriter. Jack is amazed by her performance, and they spend the night talking to each other, where Ally discusses her unsuccessful efforts in pursuing a professional music career. Ally shares with Jack some lyrics she has been working on, and he tells her she is a talented songwriter and should perform her material.\nJack invites Ally to his next show. Despite her initial refusal, she attends and, with Jack's encouragement, sings \"Shallow\" on stage with him. Jack invites Ally to go on tour with him, and they form a romantic relationship. In Arizona, Ally and Jack visit the ranch where Jack grew up and where his father is buried, only to find that Bobby had sold the land, which was converted into a wind farm. Angered at his betrayal, Jack attacks Bobby, who subsequently quits as his manager. Before doing so, Bobby reveals that he did inform Jack about the sale, but Jack was too drunk to notice.\nWhile on tour, Ally meets Rez, a record producer who offers her a contract. Although visibly bothered, Jack still supports her decision. Rez refocuses Ally away from country music and towards pop music. Jack misses one of Ally's performances after he passes out drunk in public; he recovers at the home of his best friend George \"Noodles\" Stone and later makes up with Ally. There, he proposes to Ally with an impromptu ring made from a loop of a guitar string, and they are married that same day at a church ministered by a relative of Noodles.\nDuring Ally's performance on Saturday Night Live, Bobby reconciles with Jack. Later, Ally and a drunken Jack fight over Ally's growing artistic success. Jack criticizes Ally's new image and music, as her success is outpacing his recent decline in popularity. At the Grammy Awards, where Ally is nominated in three categories, a visibly intoxicated Jack performs a tribute to Roy Orbison. Later in the evening, Ally wins Best New Artist. As she is giving her acceptance speech, a still-inebriated Jack staggers up to her, where he publicly wets himself and passes out. Ally's father, Lorenzo, berates a semi-conscious Jack while Ally attempts to help Jack sober up. Jack joins a rehabilitation program shortly thereafter. He discloses to his counselor that he tried to commit suicide at age 12 and reveals his progressively worsening tinnitus.\nJack tearfully apologizes to Ally for his behavior. While returning home, Jack admits to Bobby that it was he whom he idolized and not their father. Ally asks Rez to bring Jack on her European tour, but Rez refuses, prompting Ally to cancel the remainder of the tour to care for Jack. Rez confronts Jack and accuses him of nearly ruining Ally's career, stating that Jack will certainly relapse again, and that it is \"embarrassing\" she is married to him. That evening, Ally lies to Jack and tells him that her record label has canceled her tour so she can focus on her second album. Jack promises he will come to her concert that night, but after Ally leaves, he hangs himself in their garage.\nGrief-stricken and inconsolable after Jack's suicide, Ally is visited by Bobby, who tells her that the suicide was Jack's own choice. The closing scenes reveal a flashback of Jack working on a song about his love for Ally, which he never finished writing. Ally performs this song as a tribute to Jack, introducing herself for the first time as Ally Maine.\nAdditionally, Shangela appears as the drag bar MC, Willam Belli as drag queen Emerald, and Ron Rifkin as Jackson's rehab therapist Carl. Barry Shabaka Henley appears as Little Feet, a veteran session musician. Rebecca Field portrays Gail, while Michael Harney portrays Wolfie, a friend of Lorenzo. Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real appear as Jackson's band. Members of the supergroup band include Don Was, Victor Indrizzo and Lenny Castro. Eddie Griffin appears as a local preacher and Luenell appears as a cashier. Marlon Williams, Brandi Carlile, Alec Baldwin, Halsey and Don Roy King cameo as themselves.\nPrevious remakes of the original 1937 film included the 1954 musical and 1976 rock musical. Furthermore, the Bollywood romance film Aashiqui 2 (2013) was inspired by A Star Is Born but was not a remake.[8] Development of a new adaptation dated as far back as the late 1990s with Will Smith the intended lead player.[9] However, Smith's participation was nixed by his decision to star in Ali.[9] In 2000, Jamie Foxx and Oliver Stone were rumored to be seriously interested in remaking the film,[9] with Foxx first seeking out R&B singer Aaliyah and then rising actor Paul Walker for the leading duo roles.[10][11] Lauryn Hill and Mariah Carey were also sought for the lead roles,[9] and Alicia Keys turned down an offer to play the female lead in the film.[12] Plans for the adaptation were shelved for several years.[13]\nIn January 2011, it was announced that Clint Eastwood was in talks to direct Beyonc\u00e9 in a third American remake of the film A Star Is Born (1937), with Bradley Cooper playing the male lead. However, the project was delayed on account of Beyonc\u00e9's pregnancy.[14] In April 2012, writer Will Fetters told Collider that the script was inspired by Kurt Cobain.[15]\nOver the course of the film's development, talks with Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp and Will Smith to play the male lead failed to come to fruition. Eastwood was interested in Esperanza Spalding to play the female lead.[16] Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Shakira, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and Kesha were also considered for the lead female role. On March 24, 2015, Warner Bros. announced that Cooper was in final talks to make his directorial debut with the film. Beyonc\u00e9 was again in talks to join, though still unsigned.[17] In order to secure his first directorial commitment and in lieu of receiving an upfront salary, Cooper took a back-end deal in order to get the film made, resulting in a $39.9 million salary.[18]\nCooper revealed that originally he planned on only directing the film and did not want to star in it because he wanted to focus on directing. His first choice for the male lead was musician Jack White, but the studio rejected the idea.[19] It was then that Cooper agreed to star in the movie as well. A major issue in the development process was Warner Bros.' reluctance to deal with Jon Peters, who held the rights to the material dating back to his producing the 1976 blockbuster but had become a pariah due to his behavior. While the studio made a deal with him for the rights, they made sure his name was not listed in the credits (including those that were submitted for the Oscar nomination bids which the movie earned), and Bradley Cooper bluntly stated that a major reason his goal of having a happy and respectful set was met was that \"Jon wasn't here.\"\nCooper became the male lead while in final talks to make his directorial debut at the end of March 2016.[20][21][22] On August 16, 2016, it was reported that Lady Gaga had officially become attached and the studio had green-lit the project to begin production early 2017.[23] Beyonc\u00e9 was the first choice for the role and worked with Cooper on it for a year before leaving the project. Adele was briefly considered to replace her before Cooper met Gaga.[24] On November 9, 2016, it was reported that Ray Liotta was in talks to join the film in the role of the manager to Cooper's character, though he ultimately was not involved.[25] On March 17, 2017, Sam Elliott joined the film,[26] with Andrew Dice Clay entering negotiations to play Lorenzo, the father of Lady Gaga's character.[27] Clay was reportedly selected over Robert De Niro, John Turturro and John Travolta.[28] Howard Stern was the first choice for Elliott's role but he passed on the role.[29] In April 2017, Rafi Gavron, Michael Harney, and Rebecca Field also joined the cast.[30] In May, Dave Chappelle was cast in the film.[31] In April 2018, it was announced that Halsey would have a small role.[32]\nPrincipal photography for A Star Is Born commenced on April 17, 2017, and concluded in July 2017.[1] The production emphasized authenticity by filming concert scenes at actual music festivals with live audiences. Key performances were shot at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California, between acts by Jamey Johnson and Willie Nelson, with the crew given only eight minutes to set up and film each scene. Additional concert sequences were filmed at Coachella and Glastonbury festivals.[33][34]\nDirector Bradley Cooper and cinematographer Matthew Libatique employed a naturalistic visual style, utilizing handheld cameras and natural lighting to create an intimate atmosphere. Libatique noted that decisions regarding the film's visual style were made collaboratively, focusing on authenticity and tone.[35]\nThe production also utilized the PIX System for digital workflows, facilitating efficient collaboration among departments during filming.[36]\nAfter seeing him perform at Desert Trip festival, with Tim Vita, Cooper & Tim approached Lukas Nelson (son of country music singer Willie Nelson) and asked him to help work on the film. Nelson agreed and wrote several songs, which he sent to the producers.[37] Nelson subsequently met Lady Gaga and began writing songs with her and she, in turn, provided backing vocals on two tracks on his self-titled 2017 album.[38] The soundtrack, performed by Gaga and Cooper, was released on October 5, 2018, by Interscope Records. The studio announced that the album \"features 19 songs in a wide range of musical styles + 15 dialogue tracks that will take you on a journey that mirrors the experience of seeing the film.\"[39]\nA Star Is Born had its world premiere at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2018.[40][41] The acclaimed movie also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival,[42] the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, and the Zurich Film Festival in September 2018.[43][44] The film was theatrically released in the United States on October 5, 2018,[45] distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, after having initially been set for release on September 28, 2018, and then rescheduled to May 18, 2018, before being pushed back to October.[46][47] The studio spent an estimated $110\u00a0million promoting the film.[48]\nStarting December 7, 2018, the film had a limited release in IMAX theaters across the United States and Canada.[49] On February 28, 2019, the film was re-released in more than 1,150 US theaters with twelve minutes of additional footage. Named as the special \"encore\" edition, it contained extended performances of songs like \"Black Eyes\" and \"Alibi\" from the soundtrack, an a cappella performance of \"Shallow\" by Gaga as well as her singing \"Is That Alright?\" during the wedding sequence of Ally and Jack. Extra footage also contained Cooper singing \"Too Far Gone\" in a recording studio, and Jack and Ally writing a song titled \"Clover\" together.[50]\nThe film was available for digital download through retailers on January 15, 2019, followed by its release on Blu-ray, DVD and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 19. The home video release features 10 minutes of never-before-seen musical performances by Cooper and Gaga, and jam recording sessions of songs like \"Midnight Special\", \"Is That Alright?\" and \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\".[51] A behind-the-scenes short feature, \"The Road to Stardom: Making A Star Is Born\", was also included along with music videos for four of the songs from the soundtrack: \"Shallow\", \"Always Remember Us This Way\", \"Look What I Found\" and \"I'll Never Love Again\".[52] The 4K Blu-ray format has Dolby Vision high-dynamic-range video and remixed Dolby Atmos sound that was tailored specifically for home viewing systems.[53] In April 2019, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment announced the release of A Star Is Born: Special Encore Edition for June 4. The release includes the extended and theatrical cuts of the film. Unlike the first home media release, this version did not receive a 4K Ultra HD release.[54]\nA Star Is Born grossed $215.3\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $220.9\u00a0million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $436.2\u00a0million, against a production budget of $36\u00a0million.[7] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $178.1\u00a0million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the tenth most profitable release of 2018.[48]\nIn the United States and Canada, A Star Is Born grossed $1.35\u00a0million from select Tuesday and Wednesday night screenings, and $15.8\u00a0million on its first day, including $3.2\u00a0million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $42.9\u00a0million for the weekend and finished second at the box office, behind fellow newcomer Venom.[55] The film remained in second place in its second, third and fourth weekends, grossing a respective $28\u00a0million, $19.3\u00a0million and $14.1\u00a0million.[56][57][58] In the film's tenth weekend of release, following the announcement of its five Golden Globe nominations, the film made $2.5\u00a0million (up 38% from the previous week), including $800,000 from a limited IMAX run.[59] In the film's 17th week of release, following its eight Oscar nominations, it was added back to an additional 777 theaters (for a total of 1,192) and made $1.3\u00a0million, an increase of 107% from the previous weekend.[60] The weekend following its Best Original Song win at the Oscars, the film was added to 490 theaters (for a total of 1,235) and made $1.9\u00a0million, a 209% increase from the previous weekend.[61]\nOutside North America, the film was released concurrently in 31 other countries, and made $14.2\u00a0million in its opening weekend; its largest markets were the United Kingdom ($5.3\u00a0million), France ($2.1\u00a0million) and Germany ($1.9\u00a0million). Additional countries followed, with Japan not seeing a release until December 21.[62] The international box office for the film was substantial by the end of October 2018 despite being outpaced by the film Venom at the foreign box office. Variety magazine summarized the international performance stating: \"A Star Is Born continues to do monster business of its own. The acclaimed musical drama starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga generated an impressive $22.8 million from 75 overseas markets, bringing its tally to $74.7 million overseas and $201 million globally. A Star Is Born opened in Australia with $4.7 million in 536 venues, as well as Hong Kong with $629,000 in 58 locations. Top holdovers include the United Kingdom ($3.9 million on 846 screens), Italy ($1.5 million on 614 screens), and France ($1.5 million on 353 screens)\".[63]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 536 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With appealing leads, deft direction, and an affecting love story, A Star Is Born is a remake done right\u2014and a reminder that some stories can be just as effective in the retelling.\"[66] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[67] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[68] while PostTrak reported film-goers gave it a 90% positive score and an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars.[55]\nAlonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Cooper and Gaga are dynamite together; this is a story that lives and dies by the central relationship and the instant chemistry that must blossom between them, and these two have it in spades,\" and praised the musical numbers, describing them as \"electrifying\".[69] Owen Gleiberman of Variety lauded Cooper's directing, co-writing and acting, and called the film \"a transcendent Hollywood movie\".[70] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ and singled out Gaga's performance, saying that she \"deserves praise for her restrained, human-scale performance as a singer whose real-girl vulnerability lands miles away from the glittery meat-dress delirium of her own stage persona.\"[64] Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine found the film superior to its previous iterations and similarly praised Cooper's direction, the writing, as well the performances and chemistry of Cooper and Gaga. She stated: \"You come away feeling something for these people, flawed individuals who are trying to hold their cracked pieces of self together\u2014or to mend the cracks of those they love,\" also describing Gaga's performance as a \"knockout.\"[71]\nIn his review for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called the film \"remarkable\", and praised Cooper for his fresh take on the well-worn formula of 1937 film, as well his direction, the performances, writing, and the cinematography.[65] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4.5 out of five stars, and deemed it as a \"modern classic\", hailing the performances of Cooper and Gaga, and Cooper's direction. He found the film's screenplay and the original songs \"seamless\" and \"terrific\", and also called the film a major Oscar contender of the year and one of the year's best films.[72] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described the film as \"lavishly delightful\" and \"earthly convincing\", and added that it \"offers a suitably jaundiced glimpse of starmaking machinery at its most cynical, but also its most thrilling and gratifying.\" She similarly praised Cooper's direction, the performances and chemistry of Cooper and Gaga, and the supporting performances, particularly Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Elliott.[73] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper described it as \"electric and shatteringly powerful\" and remarked the film as one of the best versions of all the remakes, as well one of the best films of the year.[74]\nWhile praising the direction, acting and writing, Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune argues that A Star is Born's formula has always been very seductive to audiences, even when it has been written poorly, and Cooper's few missteps include being a bit of a scene hog.[75] Admitting audiences love it, and he just liked it, Phillips drew attention to a skeptical review by Lindsey Romaine for Medium who criticized the story's marginalization of the Gaga character in dealing with Cooper's manipulative addict. She at least wanted a scene where Gaga's character processed her behavior of letting the addict boyfriend get away with it. Phillips argued that it is in part the skillful musicianship which gets audiences to blow past such flaws.[76]\nIn August 2021, it was reported that Barbra Streisand, who starred in the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born, had originally criticized the \"remake of a remake\" with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, stating it was the \"wrong idea.\"[77] Streisand had contradicted the original remarks she gave in a 2018 interview with Extra, in which she claimed she \"loved it,\" and that Gaga was \"wonderful.\"[78]\nIn 2021, The Guardian placed A Star Is Born on their list of \"Remakes that Outshine the Originals\",[79] while in 2024, Variety ranked it fifth on their \"50 Greatest Romantic Movie of All Time\" list.[80] In 2023, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve cited it as among his favorite films.[81]\nA Star Is Born was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists for 2018, among them:[82]\nThe film has won a number of awards and nominations. It was chosen by both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute as one of the Top 10 Films of 2018.[83][84] The film received five nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama,[85] and eight nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for \"Shallow\".[86]\n\n### Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (From A Star Is Born/Live \u2026\nCreating...\nSaving...Removing...\nSave to Saved to\nWatch later",

This footage, however, does not capture a real car chase but computer generated images.\nIt was created by a 3D artist who uses the handle @2NCS on social media. When this video was posted to the artist's Instagram page, it was accompanied by hashtags such as #3d and #animation to indicate that this was a CGI video, not a genuine piece of footage.\n@2NCS identified himself on his website as a 23-year-old named Dionisis who lives in the United Kingdom: \"My name is Dionisis and I'm 23 years old. I live in UK. For me working as a car designer was a life goal. My motivation stems from the possibility that 3d graphics offer me, turning my imagination into reality. CGI is a great art that changed the way I express myself.\" Dinosis added that he uses the software programs Autodesk 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects to create his videos.\n@2NCS has had a few other videos go viral after internet users incorrectly assumed that they were real. In 2019, for example, a video that supposedly showed a Lamborghini evading police by sliding underneath a truck racked up more than 10 million views.\nHere's a look at how that viral video was made:\n8 April 2021 [CORRECTION]: Previous version of this article misidentified a bus as a truck.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Don't Get Duped! Here's How You Can Spot AI-Generated Video \u2026\nAI-generated video has exploded recently, making it hard to tell what\u2019s real, and what\u2019s not. These tips can help you spot the difference.\nMy title is Senior Features Writer, which is a license to write about absolutely anything if I can connect it to technology (I can). I\u2019ve been at PCMag since 2011 and have covered the surveillance state, vaccination cards, ghost guns, voting, ISIS, art, fashion, film, design, gender bias, and more. You might have seen me on TV talking about these topics or heard me on your commute home on the radio or a podcast. Or maybe you\u2019ve just seen my Bernie meme.\nAs generative AI continues to improve at a breakneck pace, it's becoming increasingly difficult to tell when something you see online is real or fabricated. And it's not just static images that we have to worry about either. AI-generated videos are on the rise as well, thanks to video generators like OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo. Now, discerning fact from AI-generated fiction is tougher than ever.\nSo how exactly do you spot videos made by AI? Currently, software-aided detection tools for AI-generated video are extremely scarce (unless you are only focused on deepfakes that have a face visible), so for now, you\u2019ll have to trust yourself instead of a robot.\nTo help you sharpen your skills and learn what to watch out for, we've gathered some Sora video samples from OpenAI (including a few that accompanied the company's research paper \u201cVideo Generation Models as World Simulators.)\u00a0Using these samples as examples, we'll show you some of the telltale signs that a video might be AI-generated. Here's what you should look for.\nUnless you\u2019re watching Inception, most filmed things follow the laws of physics. This is not so for Sora. In its paper, OpenAI talks about Sora\u2019s limitations as a simulator, saying \u201cFor example, it does not accurately model the physics of many basic interactions, like glass shattering.\" Here is a video showing a similar scenario. Glass jumps into the air, with no apparent cause nearby, and the liquid passes through the solid glass, which itself dissolves as it hits the table.\nWhen trying to determine whether a video has been created by AI, you should closely observe all of the phenomena in it, whether it\u2019s the main action, or something taking place in the background.\nAlso, gauge your feelings while you\u2019re watching. When things behave differently than they should, it\u2019s often uncomfortable for us humans, a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. So trust your gut. If something seems a bit off\u2014even if you can't quite put your finger on what exactly it is\u2014take that as a sign that the video deserves some additional scrutiny.\nSign up for the Tips, Tricks, and How-To newsletter for all of our best expert advice.\nSign up for the Tips, Tricks, and How-To newsletter for all of our best expert advice.\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nThanks for signing up!\nYour subscription has been confirmed. Keep an eye on your inbox!\nBite into an apple in real life and a chunk disappears. That's not necessarily how it works in Sora\u2019s world. OpenAI notes that \u201cinteractions, like eating food, do not always yield correct changes in object state.\u201d So while you should be monitoring actions to tell whether something is AI, it\u2019s just as important to track the reactions as well.\u00a0A lot happens in the video below, but where the man walks through the sand, there are existing footprints behind him, but no new prints are created.\nPay careful attention to a video created by AI and you\u2019ll likely notice inconsistencies. They might be glaring or just something that tugs at the corners of your thoughts. If it\u2019s the latter, note where you start to sense that something is off and re-watch it closely. In the video below, a hand paints a cherry blossom tree. While the painting develops along with the brushstrokes, there are moments when the paint from the brush changes color despite the paintbrush never leaving the canvas.\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern, now former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati repeatedly would not say what Sora was trained on beyond \"publicly available and licensed data.\u201d Putting aside the ethical and potential legal repercussions of this, it means that you can attempt to reverse engineer a video to see if it\u2019s real or not.\nNick St. Pierre, a creative director and fan of Midjourney, followed a feeling he had about the sources of Sora\u2019s work. He came up with prompts that suited Sora videos he\u2019d seen and put them through Midjourney to generate AI still images. Sure enough, he came up with over a dozen examples where Sora\u2019s videos are not much more than Midjourney images in motion. If you want to use more than your senses when assessing a video, come up with the prompt you believe it took to create them. Now, put it through a text-to-image generator to see how similar they are and a Google search to locate sources that might have been used for the video.\nText-to-video AI is still very much in its infancy right now, and since the technology is constantly evolving, the best way to avoid being fooled is to evolve along with it. As AI progresses and generates increasingly realistic footage, we'll need to adopt new tools and techniques in order to effectively spot it. So don't get comfortable just yet! Keep an eye out for new detection tools and authenticity verification systems, and be sure to check back on this article periodically\u2014we'll update it as new tools emerge.\nMy title is Senior Features Writer, which is a license to write about absolutely anything if I can connect it to technology (I can).

No, that's not true: the story originated from a satire blog but looked real enough to many people so it went viral anyway.\nThe story originated from an article published on Patheos on January 7, 2019 titled \"Vice President Pence Kicked Out Of Iceland\" (archived here) which opened:\nReykjavik, Iceland - Icelandic officials prevented Vice President Mike Pence from entering their country today. Law enforcement informed the Vice President and his team they were following the recent law protecting the populace from religious fanatics.\nIn 2017 Iceland's parliament passed a Southern Baptist travel ban. The article Atheist Iceland Issues A Travel Ban Against White Southern Baptists helps explain the reasoning behind the law:\n\"Four out of five white evangelicals voted for Trump in last year's election,\" explained Professor Andrew Kannard of the Icelandic Institute. \"The government doesn't have an encyclopedic knowledge of all the sects that comprise evangelicism in the States. They just decided to start with the most toxic group.\"\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so there was no immediate clue the story was satirical in nature:\nVice President Mike Pence gets tossed out of Iceland.\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes patheos.com as:\nAccording to NewsGuard the site can generally be trusted to maintain journalistic standards. Read their full assessment here.\nHowever on January 7, 2019 Vice President Pence wasn't in Iceland, he was in the White House talking to the press as this tweet shows:\nArchived copy of the tweet here.\nAnd the \"Laughing in Disbelief\" section of Patheos has a satire disclaimer:\nHave you clicked a link to a story and you're here?\nThe story you are reading is satirical. The post may have links to real events that the satire is based on, but the Laughing in Disbelief article is fake.\nThere are winks to readers in each piece besides the link(s) to this page that I humbly offer as hints that the story in question is satirical.\nThe story about the White Southern Baptist travel ban came from the same source and was also satirical in nature:\nGeothermal power and reason powers Iceland. Reykjavik, Iceland - This secular island country situated in the North Atlantic passed a law yesterday preventing white Southern Baptists from entering the country. Officials state that the United States of America is a country in turmoil and Southern Baptists are the ones mostly responsible.\nSee who is sharing it (it might even be your friends...) and leave the link in the comments.:\nMaarten Schenk is the co-founder and COO/CTO of Lead Stories and an expert on fake news and hoax websites.

The Kenyan government did not employ members of the Maasai tribe to whip people who failed to self-quarantine. This video actually comes from a Kenyan comedian and was created for entertainment purposes.\nThe video was first uploaded to the Mbuzi Seller YouTube account on April 2, 2020. Although Mbuzi Seller didn't provide too much information about the video, it was tagged with words such as \"comedy\" and \"entertainment.\"\nHere's the original video:\nWhile the person in this video is not a member of the Maasai tribe who was employed by the Kenyan government to whip people who disobeyed self-quarantining orders, the video was taken in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic and shows a person who is encouraging (in their own weird way) social distancing.\nMbuzi Seller responded to a number of comments below this video. In one message, they wrote that the coronavirus was \"no joke.\" In another, they explained that people should practice social distancing and stay 1 meter away from one another.\nWhile this video was created by a YouTuber and does not show a deputized government official in action,\u00a0 the government in Kenya has reportedly used violent tactics to enforce its stay-at-home orders.\nThe Washington Post reported:\nKenya's dusk-to-dawn curfew was intended to encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nInstead, security forces unleashed beatings and tear gas, injuring dozens of people, potentially exposing many more to the virus and damaging public trust in the government's strategy to contain the outbreak.\nIn cities across Kenya, policemen and other uniformed officers used their boots and batons in a brutal crackdown \u2014 with some incidents caught on video \u2014 seemingly carried out to drive home the seriousness of the curfew measure that took effect Friday.\nBearak, Max; Ombuor, Rael. \u00a0 \"Kenya\u2019s Coronavirus Curfew Begins With Wave of Police Crackdowns.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Washington Post. \u00a0 28 March 2020.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Way of Life of Maasai Tribe - YouTube\nCreating...\nSaving...Removing...\nSave to Saved to\nWatch later\n\n### Kenyan government is not using Maasai tribe men for \u2026\nA video of a man purportedly whipping people on roads and asking them to maintain one-meter distance is making rounds on social media. The claim with the video is that the Kenyan government is using Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\nClaim: Video of the Kenya Government using a Maasai tribe man to impose social distancing in Kenya.\nFact: The video is made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel \u2018Mbuzi Seller\u2019. It doesn\u2019t show a real-life incident. Also, there are no reports about the Kenyan government roping in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions in the wake of Coronavirus infections in the country. So, the claim is FALSE.\nThe video in the post has the text \u2018Mbuzziseller\u2019 on it. So, when searched with that text, a YouTube channel with the same name was found in the results. In that channel, a longer version of the same video was found. When one goes through the video carefully, it can be found that the video was shot for \u2018Entertainment\u2019 purposes. In the description of the video, \u2018#Tanzania comedy\u2019 can be seen. When one goes through the other videos of that YouTube channel, the man can be seen in the same attire as in the video posted.\nAlso, when searched if the Kenyan government roped in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions, no reports were found. When the video went viral, a news website \u2018kenyans.co.ke\u2019 has debunked the claim, which can be seen here.\nTo conclude, a video made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel is being shared as \u2018Kenyan government using Maasai tribe men for carrying out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus\u2019.\nDid you watch our new video?\nThanks for the clarifications.\nFACTLY is one of the well known Data Journalism/Public Information portals in India.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nThe myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth, which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate.\nIn a 2009 editorial written for Australia\u2019s ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: \"Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day.\"\nThis brief statement \u2014 a mere 28 words \u2014 yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic \u201ccough\u201d? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimer\u2019s second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality.\nThat useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere (estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere.\nAs CO2, in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate \u2014 a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus.\nThe erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimer\u2019s statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center:\nAccording to Houghton and Hackler, land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.\nThe 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2.\nA more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes, as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year (note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO2 not solely the carbon component):\n[CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]:\nUsing the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2.\n[CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]:\nExtrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr.\n[CO2 from other volcanic sources]:\nPerez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr.\nWhile the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year:\nThe global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr.\nOnce again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimer\u2019s claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic \u201ccough\u201d from a \u201csingle volcano\u201d to, by itself, increase Earth\u2019s annual volcanic CO2 flux by a factor of 65.\nAbsurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way:\nThere is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours.\nHowever, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year.\nA more accurate rendering of Plimer's claim would be something like \u201c3500 Mount St Helens-scale volcanic 'coughs' in a single day might be able to produce as much CO2 as humans have added to the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels to date.\u201d Such a headline would be unlikely to have the same effect as the original one, however.\nCook, John. \u00a0 \"101 Responses to Ian Plimer's Climate Questions.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Skeptical Science. \u00a0 9 May 2012.\nMonbiot, George. \u00a0 \"Ian Plimer's Volcano Claims Vaporise Under Questioning on Australian TV.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 16 December 2009.\nPilmer, Ian. \u00a0 \"Legislative Time Bomb.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News [Australia]. \u00a0 13 August 2009.\nCook, John, et al. \u00a0 \"Quantifying the Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming in the Scientific Literature.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Environmental Research Letters, \u00a0 15 May 2013.\nCarbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. \u00a0 \"Frequently Asked Global Change Questions.\"\nHoughton, Richard A. \u00a0 \"Carbon Flux to the Atmosphere from Land-Use Changes 1850-2005.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 A Compendium of Data on Global Change, \u00a0 2008.\nBurton, Michael R. et al. \u00a0 \"Deep Carbon Emissions from Volcanoes.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry. \u00a013 February 2013.\nPerez, Nemesio M., et al. \u00a0 \"Global CO2 Emission from Volcanic Lakes.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Geology. \u00a0 February 2011.\nFriedlingstein, P. et al. \u00a0 \"Update on CO2 Emissions\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Nature Geoscience. \u00a0 21 November 2010.\nUnited State Geological Survey. \u00a0 \"Volcanoes Can Affect the Earth's Climate.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Accessed 24 March 2017.\nUpdate [June 29, 2022]: Updated SEO/social.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAlex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Cleveland Volcano, Aleutian Islands - NASA\n1 MIN READ\nAt 3:00 p.m. Alaska Daylight Time on May 23, 2006, Flight Engineer Jeff Williams from International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 13 contacted the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) to report that the Cleveland Volcano had produced a plume of ash. Shortly after the activity began, he took this photograph. This picture shows the ash plume moving west-southwest from the volcano\u2019s summit. A bank of fog (upper right) is a common feature around the Aleutian Islands. The event proved to be short-lived; two hours later, the plume had completely detached from the volcano. The AVO reported that the ash cloud height could have been as high as 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) above sea level.\nCleveland Volcano, situated on the western half of Chuginadak Island, is one of the most active of the volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, which extend west-southwest from the Alaska mainland. It is a stratovolcano, composed of alternating layers of hardened lava, compacted volcanic ash, and volcanic rocks.Image credit: NASA\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\nNotifications\n\n### Mount Cleveland (Alaska) - Wikipedia\nMount Cleveland (also known as Cleveland Volcano) is a nearly symmetrical stratovolcano on the western end of Chuginadak Island, which is part of the Islands of Four Mountains just west of Umnak Island in the Fox Islands of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Mount Cleveland is 5,675\u00a0ft (1,730\u00a0m) high, and one of the most active of the 75 or more volcanoes in the larger Aleutian Arc. Aleutian natives named the island after their fire goddess, Chuginadak, who they believed inhabited the volcano. In 1894 a team from the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey visited the island and gave Mount Cleveland its current name, after then-president Grover Cleveland.\nOne of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc, Cleveland has erupted at least 22\u00a0times in the last 230\u00a0years[when?]. A VEI 3 eruption in 1944 produced the arc's only known volcanic fatality. Most recently Mount Cleveland has erupted three times in 2009, twice in 2010, once in 2011 and in 2016 and 2017.[1] The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites for monitoring. The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of the flights over the north Pacific approach the vicinity of the volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions can damage sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.\nMount Cleveland is located 490\u00a0km (304\u00a0mi) from the western end of the Aleutian Arc,[4] a long volcanic chain extending off the coast of Alaska. Containing over 75 volcanoes,[5] this volcanic arc occurs above the subduction zone where the Pacific Plate plunges under the North American Plate. As the plate moves deeper into the earth, the increasing pressure results in the loss of volatiles, certain elements and compounds with low boiling points, from various hydrous minerals. One of these compounds is water; its addition to the mantle wedge formed between the subducting and overriding plates lowers the melting point enough to allow magma to form.[6] The melted material then rises to the surface and forms a volcano\u2014in this case, the Aleutian Arc.[7][8]\nThe native Aleut name for Mount Cleveland is Chuginadak (the name currently given to the island as a whole), referring to the Aleut fire goddess, thought to reside in the volcano. The volcano's name is a reference to its constant activity, and shows that it was likely highly active even in the distant past.[9] Aleut oral tradition states that, at one time, the western and eastern halves of Chuginadak were separate islands, and that the isthmus joining them was created by volcanic activity sometime in prehistory.[10] The \"Islands of Four Mountains\" name, the geographic group name for Cleveland and its neighbors, was given to the islands by Russian cartographers in the 19th century.[11] Its current name, Mount Cleveland, was given to it by a United States Coast and Geodetic Survey expedition in 1894, when it was originally observed by the USS Concord. Like the other volcanoes in the Four Islands group, which were named after prominent American politicians at the time, Mount Cleveland was named after then-president Grover Cleveland.[10]\nMount Cleveland is an almost symmetrical andesite stratovolcano in the Islands of Four Mountains, a volcanic group in the Aleutian Arc.[4] Like all stratovolcanoes, Mount Cleveland grew as explosive eruptions, effusive eruptions, and lahars built it layer by layer into a convex shape.[12] It lies southeast of Mount Carlisle and northeast of Herbert Island. Mount Cleveland forms the western half of Chuginadak Island, a broad and uneven bell-shaped landmass, and is the highest of the four volcanic islands.[13] The island is completely uninhabited; the nearest settlement is Nikolski on Umnak Island, about 75\u00a0km (47\u00a0mi) eastward.[9]\nMount Cleveland is 8\u20138.5\u00a0km (5.0\u20135.3\u00a0mi) wide at its base[14] and roughly 29\u00a0km3 (7\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) in volume.[9] The volcano's slope increases markedly with height, from 19\u00b0 at its lower flanks to 35\u00b0 near its summit.[14] Like many other Aleutian volcanoes, Cleveland's flanks are especially rough up to 300\u00a0m (984\u00a0ft),[15] covered by multiple overlapping lava flows and debris fans that form an apron around the mountain. Lava flows are always built on top of debris flows as a result of the snow melt caused by the emission of heat just before an eruption.[9] The flows are generally short, under 1\u00a0km (0.6\u00a0mi), and thin, less than 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) thick, and are somewhat vegetated.[9] Although Mount Cleveland is the tallest mountain in the group, it is rarely completely snowed in because of its constant activity disrupts snowfall.[1] A lack of extant erosion shows that Mount Cleveland is likely a Holocene volcano, forming within the last 10,000 years.[9] All known events have occurred at Mount Cleveland's summit vent,[4] but there are at least five small andesite to dacite volcanic domes on the lower flanks.[14] At times Cleveland has had a summit lava dome. The volcano has no caldera.[4]\nThe eastern half of Chuginadak, to which Mount Cleveland is connected by a narrow isthmus, consists of several low-lying volcanic cones[1] and two prominent peaks[16] that have been heavily eroded, partly by glaciers.[1] Known as the Tana volcanic complex,[17] the two features measure 1,170\u00a0m (3,839\u00a0ft) and 1,093\u00a0m (3,586\u00a0ft) in elevation. A sample of rhyolite has been recovered from Concord Point,[16] the easternmost point on the island.[18]\nEruptions from Mount Cleveland are generally vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows,[9] lava fountains,[13] pyroclastic flows,[14] ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth,[4] and the ejection of breadcrust bombs.[14] Hot springs were reportedly found on the volcano in the 1800s,[1] and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s.[4] Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity.[9] During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.\nLittle is known about Cleveland's early eruptive history as its remoteness makes it a difficult area to investigate, and discrepancies in names have caused confusion between events there and those on nearby Carlisle. Even today, not all possible events are confirmed as eruptions by the Alaska Volcano Observatory, and many are listed as \"possible.\" In observed history, Mount Cleveland may have first erupted in 1744; the first confirmed eruption occurred in 1828. The volcano erupted again in 1836 (possibly), 1893, 1897 (possibly), 1929 (possibly), 1932, and 1938 (possibly).[4][20]\nThe first notable eruption from Mount Cleveland was a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 3 Vulcanian eruption that occurred between June 10 and June 13, 1944. Lava flows extended 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) from the summit, and an ash plume 6,000\u00a0m (19,685\u00a0ft) high was produced. Large boulders were reportedly ejected and carried out to sea by eruptive force. The eruption had the distinction of being the only confirmed direct volcanic fatality in Alaska; a small detachment from the Eleventh Air Force was stationed on the volcano at the time, and one Sergeant Fred W. Purchase left his post early in the eruption to take a walk and never returned, probably killed by mudslides. At approximately 10:20, a boat sent to search for Purchase witnessed the end of the eruption. The island was abandoned for the remainder of the war.[20]\nMount Cleveland erupted more recently in 1951, 1953, 1954 (possibly), 1975 (possibly), 1984 through 1987, 1989, 1994, and 1997. The volcano has received more focused attention in recent times due to its increased activity: it erupted in 2001, 2005, three times in 2006, 2007, three times in 2009, and twice in 2010. Of these, the most significant eruption was the 2001 eruption, which produced a 12\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) high ash plume. This plume dispersed 120 to 150\u00a0km (75 to 93\u00a0mi) across Alaska, an unusual distance that allowed detailed satellite observations to be made.[4][9] Nikolski and the surrounding region was the site of several hours of ashfall, represented in satellite imagery as areas of discolored snow.[14] This eruption significantly disrupted air traffic in the area.[4]\nOn June 19, 2012, a pilot reported an ash-producing explosion on Mount Cleveland. Due to continuing seismic activity, the volcano was placed on the USGS Volcano Watch List in the orange or \"watch\" category the following day. AVO continues to keep Cleveland on the watch because of a persistent anomaly at the summit. AVO suspects it could be dome growth. Other minor ash producing explosions occurred on June 26, July 12, and August 19.[14]\nOn May 4, 2013, the volcano began a low-level eruption, with a plume of ash observed at 15,000 feet (4,600\u00a0m).[21]\nThe volcano erupted several times in 2014 and 2015, and a single explosion was detected by the AVO on April 16, 2016.[citation needed]\nIn total the volcano has erupted at least 22 times in the last 230\u00a0years.[14]\nToday, the Alaska Volcano Observatory monitors activity at Mount Cleveland using satellite imagery. Cloud cover often obscures the volcano, which makes many events difficult to follow.[9][20][22] In addition, the low resolution of the satellite imagery allows minor events, which do not make an impression on the satellite picture, to pass unnoticed.[23] There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain[9] (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano.[23] A field study was conducted in late 2001,[14] and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005.[23] In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.[24]\nThe biggest threat posed by an eruption from Mount Cleveland is its ash plume, which can damage sensitive electronic equipment on overflying planes. Many aircraft traveling over the North Pacific and over the Arctic come within the vicinity of such a plume; the only way to avoid damage is to reroute the flight, which delays arrival time and adds $5,500 to $6,000 in extra fuel costs.[4] Cleveland has therefore been assessed by the United States Geological Survey as \"a volcano with a high aviation threat score and no real-time ground based monitoring at the present time\".[25]",

Milder conditions meant that air resources were able to fly over the fire for the first time in days.\n\u201cThe weather has abated, that\u2019s a great thing for us today,\" said Dan Quinones, one of the incident commander trainees assisting with the fire. \"We have the ability to not only keep the fire where it is, but we've also had aviation assets.\"\nQuinones said the western edge of the fire has largely stayed put, and crews are working to keep it from advancing to population centers like Grand Lake and Hot Sulphur Springs.\n\u201cThe fire continues to move at a slow rate albeit toward Shadow Mountain Lake, Lake Granby,\" he said. \"Structure resources are in there heavy making sure they can do all they can to protect those structures.\"\nHe said the coming days were critical in slowing the fire, especially with a winter storm in the forecast for Sunday. He said the wind that will likely accompany the cold front won't be ideal for the perimeters in place, but that crews are \"highly optimistic on what we've done.\"\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been reactionary over the past few days, today was proactive and we\u2019re going to take advantage of that,\" Quinones said.\nSchroetlin said there are 6,500 homes in the northern reaches of the county, and that his office is working to protect people's homes and work with utility companies to restore power ahead of the cold snap.\nBetween late Wednesday and Thursday morning, the fire went from about 24,000 acres to about 125,000 acres.\nThe fire has damaged numerous structures and prompted evacuations of entire towns, such as Estes Park and Grand Lake. The town of Granby is currently under pre-evacuation status, according to Schroetlin.\nHowever, he said Friday that some people have refused to evacuate and are choosing to stay within the fire zone. He said some of those people were moving around the evacuation zones and taking photos of properties, which he said was adding to confusion and misinformation.\n\"They're providing information from the inside to the outside,\" he said. \"That's actually causing more problems than not, because our people can't work in the field with all these other people moving around as well.\"\nHe said when their deputies encounter those people, they urge them to evacuate, and take down their information and location if they refuse so that they know who might still be behind fire lines.\n\"What ends up happening is a lot of these people who are within our fire perimeters start wandering around neighborhoods,\" he said. \"They're taking pictures of houses that could be potentially damaged which is just increasing that rumor mill.\"\nHe said homeowners are finding second-hand on social media that their homes have been destroyed.\n\"I'm asking people not to do that, we really need to get in there and get that official word out,\" the sheriff said.\nOn Thursday, a spot fire made it over the Continental Divide and into Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP).\nThe spot fire traveled more than a mile and over barren terrain above tree line.\n\"For a spot fire to carry a mile to two is not that common, although, in general, this fire was moving with spotting up to a mile as a fairly common mechanism,\" said Incident Commander Noel Livingston. \"This is a little farther than that. It certainly went over some bare ground, bare rock, above timberline; we were hoping that wouldn't happen.\"\nAbout 1,200 acres of fire has become established in drainages within the park between the Divide and Estes Park.\nAll routes into the popular tourist town are now closed, and the roads are open for exit only.\n\"Evacuate the area immediately and as quickly as possible. Do not delay leaving to gather belongings or make efforts to protect your home or business,\" a bulletin from the Larimer County Sheriff's Office reads. \"Evacuating immediately not only supports your safety but also allows emergency crews better access to the area.\"\nRMNP has been entirely closed to the public, and mandatory evacuations are underway for much of the western side of it and parts of Estes Park.\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the park said there were \"rapid evacuations\" of park staff on Wednesday and that there was \"some structure loss\" on the west side of the park, but an initial assessment indicates that it is minimal.\nShe said they've been unable to fully assess the area due to the fire, which is in the area about 1.5 miles from the head of Tonahutu Creek to the head of Spruce Creek. It is in the same general area as the Fern Lake Fire of 2012.\n> The video below shows a long line of vehicles leaving Estes Park on Thursday afternoon following the evacuation orders:\nTo stream 9NEWS on your phone, you need the 9NEWS app.\nNext up in 5\nOhio State's Blueprint for Success TERRIFIES Opponents | Will Buckeyes Crush All Challengers?\nNEXT UP IN 5\nOhio State's Blueprint for Success TERRIFIES Opponents | Will Buckeyes Crush All Challengers?\nHeartbreak: Why Indiana Pacers came up short in Game 7 of NBA Finals, Tyrese Haliburton gets injured\nWill Arkansas Ever Win A National Title Again?\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are the TEAM TO BEAT in the East! | Cavs TRIED to TRADE for Kevin Durant?!\nHow Does the Kevin Durant Trade Impact the Timberwolves and the West? | What's the Draft Strategy?\nFor logistical efficiency, fire officials have determined that the spot fires from the East Troublesome Fire that lie east of the Divide will be managed by the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team that is managing the Cameron Peak Fire.\nThe spots will be known as the East Zone of the East Troublesome Fire.\nRELATED: A list of information for wildfire evacuees\nPre-evacuation orders have been issued for the town of Granby, Granby Ranch and Grand Elk to Hot Sulphur Springs to County Road 55 to County Road 88.\n\"At this point no injuries, no deaths, lots of structure loss, to be honest,\" Schroetlin said.\nThe fire is believed to be human-caused.\n\"This is absolutely the most intense fire behavior I've seen in the years that I've been doing wildland fires,\" Christopher Joyner, the fire information officer for the East Troublesome Fire, said.\nRELATED: Colorado wildfires: How you can help those impacted\nHere's a look at what information is available regarding the wildfire right now.\nThe following areas are under a mandatory evacuation order:\n\"Those are going to remain in place for the foreseeable future,\" said Schroetlin. \"There's really not even a good now to even discuss when we're going to release those.\"\nHere's a map of the Grand County evacuations:\nThe Larimer County Sheriff's Office has also upgraded these once-voluntary evacuations in Estes Park to mandatory status:\nVoluntary evacuations in Estes Park now include:\nThe Stanley Hotel, located at 333 E.

Those leaving via Highway 7 should go to the Isle of Capri at 401 Main St. in Black Hawk.\nAnyone forced to evacuate was asked to register using East Troublesome Fire Evacuee(s) Registration Form to assist with the re-entry process, the GCSO said.\nThe Joint Information Center will be open until 8 p.m. to answer questions. Call 970-980-2500. It will reopen at 8 a.m. on Friday.\nThose evacuating Estes Park via US 34 or US 36 can bring their small animals to the Riverdale Animal Shelter of Adams County.

Three firefighters who live outside of that area have lost their homes, the Facebook post reads.\nThe sheriff's office said Friday that damage assessment will take time and also noted that due to the changing nature of the fire, some places that were OK earlier might not be OK now.\n\"Just as I walked in here, people were still up there working on life safety structure protection,\" Schroetlin said. \"It's really too early to give an assessment of what we have in there. Literally, as I'm walking in here, I hear radio traffic from crews in the field, an area we thought was good the other day has fire in it. There's fire close to houses.\"\nHe went on to say that the situation has changed with almost every pass through he's made, and said they're not withholding any information but that they simply don't know.\nThe owner of the historic Grand Lake Lodge previously told 9NEWS Mountain Newsroom Reporter Matt Renoux that it remains intact following the fire.\nSome structures have been lost in nearby Rocky Mountain National Park.\nThe boundaries of the East Troublesome Fire and Cameron Peak Fire are now 11 miles apart, meaning firefighters are preparing for the possibility that the two could merge.\nThe Cameron Peak Fire is the largest in Colorado's recorded history.\nFire Incident Commander Noel Livingston said that firefighters are preparing for this possibility, and while the East Troublesome Fire is a top priority in the state, it is competing with Colorado's other wildfires and those on the West Coast for resources.\nRELATED: Record-setting wildfire season, pandemic putting strain on volunteer fire stations\nDuring an update on Thursday evening, fire officials said cold temperatures on Thursday helped a spot fire slow down its movement toward the town of Estes Park.\nForecasted snow this weekend is projected to help firefighting efforts, but won't be enough to fully extinguished them, an NWS spokesperson said during a news conference Thursday afternoon.\nThe U.S. Forest Service announced new closures to public lands, citing \"extreme fire behavior.\"\nThe Sulphur Ranger District has been added to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest\u2019s temporary closure of National Forest land in Grand, Clear Creek, Gilpin, Boulder, Larimer and part of Jefferson counties, effective at noon Thursday.\nThe Routt National Forest will be adjusting its area closure into Jackson County.\nThe closure area includes the southern Troublesome area west of Highway 125 and north to Willow Creek Pass. Also included are public lands in the area east of the Highway 125/US 40 junction to US 34 and north to Grand Lake.\nKey trailheads and landmarks in the closure area include: Wheatley, Elk Mountain, Bill Miller, Trail Creek, Willow Creek Pass, Illinois Pass, Stillwater Pass, North Supply, Supply Creek, Idleglen and Willow Creek Reservoir. The Bowen Gulch Protection Area and the southern portion of the Never Summer Wilderness Area are included in the closure.\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has also implemented two area closures encompassing approximately 32,000 acres in Grand and Jackson counties. You can see the exact closures in the maps here.\nThe Georgetown, Bergen Peak & Mount Evans State Wildlife Areas are also closing indefinitely due to concern over the expanding fires and extreme fire conditions. Refunds to hunters with second season rifle tags in that unit will be offered.\nSUGGESTED VIDEOS:\u00a0Local stories from 9NEWS\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

But the video is miscaptioned: the object that may look like a truck is actually a reusable weighted sled the Navy built for this exact purpose.\nA viral Facebook video appears to show the Navy launching a huge truck off the deck of an aircraft carrier and into the water, and its caption confirms this. But the video is miscaptioned and the Navy was using a specially-designed sled.\nA Facebook page called \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d posted a 15 second video clip on February 9th, 2019. The clip is a panning shot of a large object flying off the deck of a distant aircraft carrier and crashing into the water.\nThe video is surrounded by two letterbox style black strips with the following caption:\n\u201cTrucks were just launched off the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to test its jet catapult system. Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you we can afford Medicare for all or the Green New Deal.\u201dThe Other 98% via Facebook\nThe video has racked up over 1,000 comments and 5,900 reactions (such as likes and emojis). It has also been viewed 385,000 times. But this clip is cut out of a much longer video published by the Navy in 2015, and it only tells part of the story.\nModern aircraft carriers use highly advanced Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to catapult fighter jets off their decks at incredible speeds. These catapults must be calibrated and tested, so the Navy has invented a \u201cdead load\u201d to launch.\nThe dead load is a sled with four wheels that the Navy can load with up to 30,000 pounds in weights. These sleds are not equipped with any expensive electronics or other special equipment. That said, the Navy often conducts its tests in shallow water so it can retrieve and re-use its \u201cdead load\u201d sleds.\nThe Navy conducted the USS Gerald Ford EMALS test shown in \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d Facebook video in the James River. What\u2019s more, it was able to retrieve the sled for future tests. You can see the entire test in the video below:\nThe comments section of \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d video make it clear that many viewers were not fooled by the caption claiming the Navy was using a truck to test its EMALS system.\nDaniel Loope said, \u201cThose \u2018trucks\u2019 are test devices. They are recoverable data gathering instruments.\u201d\nJerry Slater added, \u201cThese really aren\u2019t trucks you could drive, They are test tools called \u2018Trucks.'\u201d\nGregg Long wrote, \u201cThere needs to be a retraction on this post. These vehicles being launched by the catapult are purpose built and retrieved and used over and over again. There is no waste here\u2026\u201d\nSo while the Navy does not use functional trucks to test its jet catapult system, some have wrongly claimed it does. But most people did not fall for the misdirection.\nWhat Brand Truck Does the Russian Military Drive?\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window.

Fame, power, money? That much is clear. But James Blunt? Yeah, some people are even willing to die for James Blunt.\nThe English singer has been on tour in Germany since Monday. He landed his first major hit with \"You\u2019re beautiful,\u201d which starts with a short guitar intro, with Blunt then joining in with his meltingly soft voice: \"I saw your face, in a crowded place, and I don't know what to do ...\"\nHamburg\u2019s Elbphilharmonie Concert Hall was supposed be just such a \"crowded place\u201d on Wednesday evening, despite the threat of the coronavirus. Around 2,100 fans had tickets, even though some must have been wondering over the past couple of days whether they should actually go.\nA day earlier, James Blunt had performed a concert in Leipzig as if the coronavirus didn\u2019t exist. By the point, the city of Hannover had already cancelled his planned Thursday concert there. And between those two dates, there was Hamburg, with 2,100 people in a concert hall - the kind of event that virologists are now saying are high risk.\nOn the other hand, the gig at the Elbphilharmonie was the last chance for fans to go out before a mass wave of closures of public spaces that is now expected in Germany. \"We shared a moment, that will last 'til the end,\u201d as the Blunt lyric goes. One more magic moment, one that will stay in our memory \u2013 that\u2019s what live concerts are all about. It almost makes you wonder how many joked that this would be their last moment of normal life?\nThe cancellation came on Wednesday afternoon. Blunt still performed the concert, but instead of a live audience, it was streamed on the internet. Tour sponsor Deutsche Telekom got cold feet. The planned concert at Hamburg\u2019s Barclaycard Arena three days later had already been cancelled by the city, which has imposed a ban on any events with more than 1,000 guests. The void has now arrived in Hamburg, too, and no one knows how long it will last.\nOne week ago, German Health Minister Jens Spahn issued a recommendation that any event with more than 1,000 attendees be cancelled. Since then, Germany has slowly been turning into a ghost town. Professional football matches have been played in empty stadiums in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bremen, the opera, concert halls and theaters have been closed in Bavaria and Berlin, semester breaks have been extended at universities in Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the literature festival Lit.Cologne has been cancelled as was the Leipzig Book Festival, for the first time in 71 years. The point behind all these measures is to flatten the curve of infections and to win time in order to ensure the hospitals aren\u2019t overflowing and thus save human lives.\nFootball matches continued to play to full stadiums in Leipzig, Rostock and Stuttgart, and Hamburg\u2019s Elbphilharmonie continued with its concert program until Tuesday. Life had to go on somehow. But can it continue to go on like that?\nAll across the country, public officials and politicians have been seeking a common line on whether they should approve events or cancel them. That line, though, was rather serpentine \u2013 and the reason for that quickly became clear: It\u2019s due to Germany\u2019s system of federalism. Responsibility for decisions on infection control lies entirely with the German states, municipalities and administrative districts and not with the federal government in Berlin. In some places, officials quickly recognized that the virus would spread rapidly and that there would be tens of thousands of deaths if no action was taken. At least that\u2019s how all serious virologists view the situation.\nBut in some places, it appears that officials really did believe that COVID-19 would be some kind of mild flu, not much different from a normal winter flu. So why shut everything down? Why not take a wait-and-see approach?\nWilly-nilly decisions were made across the country as the German health minister recommended closures, but could do nothing to actually make sure they happened. With no ability to issue orders, all he could do was encourage officials to take action. Spahn lamented on Germany\u2019s national public radio station that he would like to see \"a somewhat more uniform approach.\u201d\nIt was only on Thursday, at a meeting between Germany\u2019s state governors and Chancellor Angela Merkel, that a general position began to crystalize \u2013 the strict one that Spahn had been recommending. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that German federalism has massively slowed down the official response to the pandemic. The decisions on how to deal with the coronavirus had to go through around 400 public health departments across Germany. And through 16 state governments, which largely left the decision-making to those public health departments.\nBut it\u2019s also true to say that the coronavirus has already plunged Germany into an ethical dilemma that would still be there regardless of who is in charge. It pits two of our highest values against each other, without any real way of reconciling them \u2013 that of protecting lives and that of having a free society. The virus requires a decision on what weighs most heavily: the danger of death posed to individuals or the death of public life. Protecting lives would require rigorous decisions to cancel events and close things. Who, after all, wants to be responsible for the loss of even a single life?\nOn the other hand, a country where everything is closed or cancelled, where people can\u2019t live freely, isn\u2019t what people expect from a free country. It lacks freedom of assembly, the freedom of people to manifest their personalities or participate in public life, politics, culture and sport. And what will happen if this lasts not just two or three weeks, but two or three months, as Spahn has indicated it might? Or if there is no end in sight?\nSet against that conflict, any decision made can seem like the wrong one \u2013 and that\u2019s why officials have been so torn across all of Germany in recent days and why decisions are being made without any apparent overarching plan. The strength of a federal state is its ability to adapt to any local situation, but that can also be its greatest weakness, since it requires so many decisions and so many of them can be the wrong ones. The same thing happens in the event of an imminent pandemic.\nIt creates a situation in which a country with 16 states responds at 16 different speeds to the coronavirus. The Chinese office of the World Health Organization first reported a growing number of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on Dec. 31, 2019. Nine days later, the Chinese authorities confirmed that a new virus had emerged. That\u2019s the point at which the clock began ticking for the entire world, even for generally well-organized Germany, a country that has sophisticated pandemic plans at the federal, state and local levels in addition to the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, which acts as Germany\u2019s center for disease control. The institute also has a prestigious think tank working in the field of infectious diseases.\nIn addition, Germany\u2019s Protection from Infection Act even provides the authorities with considerable leeway to restrict certain freedoms in an emergency. Orders can be given for the cancellation of events. People can be placed under mandatory quarantine. And officials can even force their way into people\u2019s homes to take saliva samples. All this and more is allowed in order to contain the threat of a disease spreading.\nThe article you are reading originally appeared in German in issue 12/2020 (March 14, 2020) of DER SPIEGEL.\nFAQ: Everything You Need to Know about DER SPIEGEL\nSeven Decades of Quality Journalism: The History of DER SPIEGEL\nReprints: How To License SPIEGEL Articles\nHowever, responsibility for all this lies with the states in the Federal Republic of Germany, and that\u2019s also how it should be considering that Germany\u2019s postwar democratic structures were created as an antidote to the centralized, authoritarian leadership principles of the Nazis.\nUnder the system, decisions are supposed to be made as close to the people as possible, where they are. Under that same logic, the federal states also largely pass responsibility for protection from infectious diseases downward. In Hamburg, for example, it is primarily delegated to the district authorities. In Hesse, the districts and the independent cities are responsible. In cases of importance across multiple regions, the state government can intervene and issue orders to the local authorities.\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that the Robert Koch Institute considered this political structure to be the best solution. The last pandemic, the 2009 swine flu, which caused an estimated 350 deaths in Germany and 200,000 victims globally, showed that the effects \"can vary greatly, even within a large country like Germany. That\u2019s why it\u2019s possible, for example, for some states to undertake measures that aren\u2019t necessary in other areas.\u201d The regional approach to the fight against the swine flu was one of the reasons it went so smoothly in Germany, the institute stated. Praise, essentially, for the federalist system.\nIt appears that it took the German government quite a bit of time before they began realizing that a new virus and pathogen that poses an entirely different scale of danger could easily overwhelm regional or provincial health authorities. The federal government didn\u2019t even set up a central crisis committee in Berlin until Feb. 27.\nIn France, President Emmanuel Macron, declared the corona epidemic to be his country\u2019s main priority. He issued a decree capping the price of disinfectants and ordering the government seizure of protective face masks. In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took the unprecedented move of placing a country of 60-million residents under what is essentially house arrest. In Poland, meanwhile, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki banned all mass gatherings and, like several other countries, closed all daycare centers, schools and universities. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has held back, almost to the point of invisibility, as her health minister was dispatched to give out friendly advice.\nAll this as the number of infections shot up, the first Germans had died, and everyone had become cognizant of the fact that 60 to 70 percent of the population could ultimately get infected. The notes of a meeting that Helge Braun, the chief of staff at Merkel's Chancellery, held with his counterparts at the state level last week show that he conceded that \"containment,\" the isolation of the infected and the people they have come into contact with, \"probably won't work in Germany.\"\nAll the more reason, one might think, to centralize power in such a situation, but instead, laments Carsten Schneider, a senior member of parliament with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), \"every district medical officer has more of a say than the federal health minister.\u201d Not everyone in the coalition government between the SPD and Merkel\u2019s conservatives shares that view, though. Antje Tillmann, a member of parliament with the conservatives, believes the best way to fight epidemics is still at the state and municipal level. Even with centralized decision-making structures, France and Italy have higher corona death rates than Germany. Nevertheless, Karl Lauterbach, the health policy coordinator for the SPD and a leading health expert in Germany, who is himself currently under quarantine, has scathing criticism for Germany\u2019s pandemic policies so far. \"What we\u2019re experiencing now is a warning shot. It shows that our federal system doesn\u2019t work in the fight against epidemics in the 21st century.\"\nIt\u2019s a warning shot that Health Minister Spahn also likely heard at some point in recent days. Since that point, it\u2019s clear the he has been trying to gain the upper hand \u2013 if the laws didn\u2019t give him much power, then he at least had to take the lead in the debate. Spahn\u2019s power is his words, and after a week of duking it out with the states, it now appears that the things he\u2019s been calling for will now be enforced.\nIt took a long time before he found the courage to act so firmly. The crisis committee he assembled together with German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, meets twice a week. Officials from the Robert Koch Institute provide a briefing, information is gathered and measures are recommended. The meetings are also attended by representatives of the foreign, defense, finance and transport ministries as well as by officials from the Chancellery and each of the German states. Afterward, the health and interior ministers of each state are also informed about the discussions that took place.\nThings have gone pretty well in the coronavirus crisis on issues where the federal government has jurisdiction. But it doesn\u2019t have much jurisdiction beyond placing bans on flights or people entering the country or imposing border controls. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, officials quickly addressed the issue of border protection. With the coronavirus raging through Italy, Austria imposed a general ban on entry into the country for people traveling from Italy.\nRather than performing to an audience, English pop star James Blunt performed to an empty hall in Hamburg on Wednesday and live streamed the event for his fans.\nThe panel also decided that it was time for Germany to act. They requested that the Federal Police now check travelers at German-Austrian border for symptoms. \"We'll do it,\" said Federal Police hear Dieter Romann, who is also a member of the crisis committee. Federal Police officers have since been questioning travelers from Italy about possible symptoms of the disease. On Thursday, Interior Minister Seehofer also moved to further tighten procedures, expanding the controls to all borders to Germany.\nThe next issue addressed was procurement. Doctors and nurses aren\u2019t allowed to administer corona tests or provide treatment to those infected without special respiratory masks and protective clothing. Even normal surgical masks could become scarce in hospitals.\nAfter the crisis committee forbade the export of protective masks a week ago, Germany\u2019s Armed Forces are now stepping in to help: The Bundeswehr\u2019s procurement office in Koblenz is sending staff out around the world to track down remaining stocks of masks and ventilators for intensive care units. They\u2019re even tracking down sources in the United States.\nBut things grow more complicated when the German states have to play along. To cite one example of many: The district of Euskirchen in North Rhine-Westphalia has just under 200,000 residents and had four confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Thursday. The main person responsible for combating the coronavirus here is a man named Christian Ramolla, the head of Department 53, \"Health.\u201d At the beginning of February, as experts at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin were still mulling ways they could ward off the impending epidemic, Ramolla was also coming up with a plan: his own. On two pages, he noted that it was necessary \"to protect sensitive structures in the district of Euskirchen.\u201d He wrote that he wanted to prevent a scenario in which \"medical practices had to close because employees were sent into quarantine, trash collectors were no longer allowed to work or the waterworks were left unstaffed.\u201d It\u2019s also his opinion that not everyone who comes into contact with an infected person should be placed under immediate quarantine. Nor did it bother him much that his stance deviated from the Robert Koch Institute\u2019s firm position on putting those infected or exposed into isolation. He also had the backing of the district government and the state. Their view was that Berlin wasn\u2019t responsible and it was far away.\nBut there has been no other area where the crisis committee\u2019s impotence has been as obvious as it is on the question of whether to cancel football matches, concerts or trade fairs. Initially, the federal government\u2019s crisis managers felt it was better not to intervene, that things needed to be left to the states \u2013 otherwise the federal government would soon find itself having to make a decision about every little village fair. That was also Spahn's position. So two weeks ago, the crisis committee decided to refer to the Robert Koch Institute's more stringent recommendations, but to keep things sufficiently vague so that the states would still have a free hand. Decisions on whether to approve events without any changes or to impose conditions or push for them to be postponed or totally cancelled was a matter for the states. Talk of the 1,000-visitor-limits that have now become the norm hadn\u2019t even begun yet.\nBut the number of questions being asked of the Federal Health Ministry by the states and the districts started growing. Why did all the vague statements really mean? And when could they expect clear announcements so that the football clubs and concert managers wouldn\u2019t be directing their anger solely at them? Yet others wanted to hear as little as possible from Berlin, so that they could still hold a festival or football match. Just last weekend, the Bundesliga, Germany\u2019s top football league, played all of its matches in stadiums filled with fans. Hadn\u2019t anyone heard about the coronavirus?\nBy Sunday, Spahn had had enough and broke out of the corset federalism places on federal ministers. He tweeted that events with more than 1,000 participants should be cancelled. Pro forma, he added \"from my point of view,\" to the end of his message, but it still marked the beginning of the fight. And although many in the states might not have realized it immediately, that fight had already been won. In a crisis, the side that offers the greatest possible safety wins. To risk something when others are issuing urgent warnings is not a political survival strategy.\nBut it still took some time for the states to realize that Health Minister Spahn had prevailed. In Stuttgart, the public health office was hesitant to lock fans out of the stadiums at the match between the local team VfB Stuttgart and Arminia Bielefeld on Monday. By that point, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where the match was to be held, was the state with the second most infections in the country, with 234 cases, but the top match between the second division teams was apparently more important.\nJust as in Leipzig. The fact that the annual Leipzig Book Fair was cancelled on March 3 under pressure from the federal government had already hit the city hard. And now it was supposed to keep the fans out of the stadium of the first Champions Leagues round of 16 in the history of the RB Leipzig football team? The team has not only become the city\u2019s most famous brand, but also a provider of 3,000 to 8,000 jobs in the region, as Mayor Burkhard Jung once said. The city ultimately refused to keep fans at home on Tuesday, the justification being that the opposing team, Tottenham, didn't come from a coronavirus hotspot. All the better that James Blunt from England was also there. He was allowed to sing in front of 5,000 fans that same evening in a different venue about 400 meters away as the crow flies. The fact that Britain had experienced six COVID-19 deaths by then? Didn't matter.\nThe football team Eintracht Frankfurt was also supposed to play a Europa League match in a sold-out stadium on Thursday night against FC Basel. Ren\u00e9 Gottschalk, the head of the public health department in Frankfurt, argued on Monday that he didn\u2019t think there would be too many spectators from risk areas such as Italy or Iran coming to the Frankfurt stadium. Moreover, he argued that the risk of infection is much higher in confined spaces or party tents.\nRobert Koch Institute President Lothar Wieler, German Health Minister Jens Spahn and Chancellor Angela Merkel at a coronavirus press conference in Berlin\nTwo days later, more of the same. Only this time, Gottschalk was claiming that the statistical risk of infection in a stadium is zero. Just hours later, Gottschalk found himself sitting in front of the press again, but this time he had to explain that the match would be played in an empty stadium after all. He said the risks were minimal, but that the Robert Koch Institute had issued a new risk assessment for the Alsace region, which is also home to a number of FC Basel fans.\nIn Hannover, Hauke Jagau, the regional president responsible for the decision, said on Monday that a closer look would be taken at the thousands of visitors planning to attend the James Blunt concert in the TUI Arena three days later. The attendees were coming from close by, and not from risk regions, he argued. Health Minister Carola Reimann took a similar position. She argued that the virus wasn\u2019t even circulating in Lower Saxony yet. Then the concert was cancelled after all.\nThis kind of reticence continued across the country until the middle of the week. Kai Klose, the social minister in the central German state of Hesse, which had 30 known cases on Monday, claimed that the situation in the state could not be compared to the one in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), which by that point had 500 confirmed cases. The governor of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, said it did make any sense for \"some person in Berlin to make stipulations that apply down to the smallest village.\u201d\nBut by that point, others had already begun retreating, and then the states fell like dominoes. The first to drop was North Rhine-Westphalia Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann on Sunday evening, who announced on a talk show that, for now, Bundesliga games would no longer be played in front of fans in his state. Then came Bavaria on Monday: No more events with more than 1,000 attendees. On Tuesday, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia and Bremen followed suit. Under pressure from Spahn\u2019s tweet, they all suddenly realized that they could easily implement quite a few measures.\nThen came Saxony on Wednesday, one day after an RB Leipzig game. The first event to be postponed was the 61st Congress of the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine in Leipzig, which was to gather precisely the doctors needed to take care of corona patients.\nOther states, however, once again made it clear that they didn\u2019t approve of the overall direction of things, and decided to limit their measures to non-binding recommendations to cancel events with more than 1,000 visitors. This included Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, which also suggested that this limit only be implemented for indoor spaces, not for outdoor gatherings. Governor Dreyer grumbled that the number 1,000 had been \"plucked\u201d out of the air and that it was not scientifically justified. She argued that, for many events in closed spaces, the figure was much too high, while more visitors could safely attend events outdoors.\nBut there was enormous pressure on the states to agree on a plan of action by Thursday at the latest, when governors were scheduled to meet with Chancellor Merkel. Even before the group separated again, Hesse and Hamburg announced that they were also implementing a 1,000-person limit. That evening, the chancellor explained that the federal and state governments had agreed not only to cancel events with more than 1,000 participants, but also to call off all non-essential gatherings with smaller numbers of participants. Bavarian Governor Marcus S\u00f6der specified that \"essential\u201d meant legally essential, infrastructurally essential and economically essential. Everything else, he said, should not take place. The measures were to be implemented for four to five weeks, for now.\nUltimately, they were also under pressure from their own health authorities, who wanted clarity, and from event organizers, who didn\u2019t want to be left hanging with costs. Cancelling an event was hard enough. But additional requests for compensation from artists and ticket buyers would have been even worse. As long as authorities were only recommending that events be cancelled, the event-organizers were trapped \"on the fence,\u201d says Tobias Lerch, a lawyer from the northern German city of Celle. It is possible that, in such cases, the organizer would have to pay the artists and for the space, and also return money to ticket-holders.\nIf the ban is mandatory, things might be different. The situation would potentially qualify as a force majeure, in which case they might be entitled to compensation. According to Hamburg administrative lawyer Sigrid Wienhues, this would probably not be based directly on the Protection Against Infection Act, \"but on general regulatory law.\u201d The states would then have to pay, which could be expensive.\nIn at least one area, however, the coronavirus will save the government a lot of money. In the first week of April, a date that had previously been secret, a transport carrying nuclear waste from the British reprocessing plant in Sellafield was set to arrive at the Biblis nuclear power plant in Hesse. It was to be the first of four planned deliveries from English and French facilities between now and 2024.\nBut the German Federal Police would have had to protect the train route with 600 officers. Officials in Berlin were concerned that such a large number of officers in a contained area could lead to mass infections on the force. Even without the nuclear transport, the German Federal Police had reported 135 potential infections among its ranks by the start of the week, as well as three confirmed cases.\nThen came a decision by Interior Minister Horst Seehofer to cancel the operation. A memo by Romann, the head of the German Federal Police, said that the transport was \"as of immediately cancelled\u201d and that the deployment \"could not be authorized\u201d given the current spread of the coronavirus. In the midst of a pandemic, it turns out, even anti-nuclear protests are considered public events with more than 1,000 people.\nBy Matthias Bartsch, Annette Bruhns, J\u00fcrgen Dahlkamp, Michael Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf, Hubert Gude, Dietmar Hipp, Julia J\u00fcttner, Veit Medick, Lydia Rosenfelder, Jonas Schaible, Cornelia Schmergal, Ansgar Siemens, Lukas Stern, Steffen Winter\nA meeting the German government's coronavirus crisis committee\nRather than performing to an audience, English pop star James Blunt performed to an empty hall in Hamburg on Wednesday and live streamed the event for his fans.\nRobert Koch Institute President Lothar Wieler, German Health Minister Jens Spahn and Chancellor Angela Merkel at a coronavirus press conference in Berlin\n\n### Berlin: Corona Still Keeps the Tourists Away\nBerlin's new tourism numbers are in, and they look pretty bad. The pandemic took the tourist magnet back to the level of 2001.\nBerlin, March 4th, 2022 (The Berlin Spectator) \u2014\u00a0Berlin is stunning. No other city in Germany, on the continent or in the world is quite like it. The atmosphere in the German capital is unique. It offers a lot of culture, at least when Corona lets it. And there is so much to see, including the remainder of the Wall. In the past 77 years, Berlin has turned from the capital of fascist Nazi Germany to that of the democratic Federal Republic of Germany. In between, the mean regime of the GDR ruled in Berlin as well. Countless historic sites tell the story of this city.\nSomething for Everyone\nEach of the nearly 14 million tourists who came to Berlin in 2019 had preferences. Some came to the city of cities to fall in love. Others wanted to dance and get drunk, to visit as many museums as possible, to follow the Berlin Wall Path, to experience stunning concerts, or to sit in beer gardens and watch people walk by. Yes, there is something for everyone, except when a pandemic screws it all up.\nBecause of two lockdowns and high infection numbers with many hospitalizations, 2021 was a bad year. Most of the city's 115,000 hotel beds did not have to be made in the mornings because they were not used. Millions of meals, snacks and ice cream cones could have been sold at Berlin's 7,000 restaurants, caf\u00e9s and ice cream parlors last year if tourists had ordered them. Thousands of seats in cultural venues would have been filled by just as many visitors if Corona had not spread all over the damned planet.\nDutch, Danes and Poles\nReady for an overdose of numbers? Here we go: According to 'Visit Berlin', the company that promotes Berlin as a tourist destination and insists on being spelled 'visitBerlin', 5.13 million tourists came to the city in 2021, just like in 2001, and spent 13.96 million nights here, even though the year only had 365 of them. The only good news is that the number of guests in 2021 increased by 3.7 percent compared to 2020, a year that was even worse, and the number of nights spent at hotels and similar establishments was 13.7 percent higher.\nLet's get back to the bad news: Last year, Berlin registered only 37 percent of the number of tourists who had come in 2019, before Corona hit. The number of nights spent was 41 percent of the level it had had in 2019. Also the share of foreign tourists decreased, for obvious reasons. In 2021, 71 percent of all tourists in Berlin were Germans. The Dutch, Danes and Poles were the largest groups of foreign tourists. As usual, there were more visitors from the United States than from any other country on continents other than Europe.\nNew Problem\nNow that the Omicron wave is supposed to recede, and now that most Corona restrictions will be dumped, things could have improved substantially. But, as it turns out, there is a new problem. The war of aggression Russia started against its smaller neighbor Ukraine will not exactly help tourism in Berlin or anywhere in Europe. Besides, Corona might return in fall, if it actually vanishes beforehand.\nWe have a favor to ask: As of March 3rd, 2022, nine readers are supporting The Berlin Spectator on a monthly basis.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn May 2020, as cities across the United States saw protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some social media users argued that these protests were hypocritical as there were no protests or riots after a white woman named Ricky Ellsworth was killed by a black police officer in the same state:\nBut that argument was flawed (in both its facts and punctuation). This meme conflates two unrelated incidents and makes a faulty comparison to the protests against racial injustice in 2020.\nFor starters, the woman in this photograph is not \"Ricky Ellsworth.\" This meme is likely referring to a woman named Ricci Ellsworth, not Ricky, who was killed in 1997 by her ex-boyfriend Michael Rimmer. Ellsworth was killed near Memphis, Tennessee, not in Minnesota, and Rimmer was not a police officer.\nRimmer, a white man, was sentenced to death for the killing in 1998. Rimmer was sentenced to death again in 2004 at a re-sentencing, and then again in 2016.\nIn any case, Ellsworth is not the person pictured in the meme. This meme actually shows a woman named Justine Damond, or Justine Ruszczyk, who was truly killed by a police officer named Mohamed Noor in Minneapolis in 2017. The Star Tribune reported, \"A 40-year-old woman who family members said called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home Saturday night was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer.\"\nAlthough Damond's killing stirred up anger in Minneapolis, the vigils in her name paled in comparison to the protests that followed the killings of young black men at the hands of police officers, such as Michael Brown or Eric Garner. This fact is frequently invoked by those arguing that the injustices claimed by Black Lives Matter movement are somehow exaggerated or overblown. The above-displayed meme, for instance, raises the leading question: \"Why didn't they riot when a black officer killed a white woman?\"\nBut, as is usually the case, there is more to the story than the meme conveys.\nA week before Damond was killed by black police officer in Minneapolis, a black man named Philando Castile was killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. Although there are a number of similarities between these two incidents (both, for example, involve an officer killing a civilian), there are also some key differences, mainly in how they were handled.\nNoor, the officer who shot and killed Damond, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison after he was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Philando Castile, was acquitted on all charges.\nDamon and Castille also received different settlements from the city of Minneapolis. Damond's family received $20 million from the city, while Castile's family received $3 million:\nThe mother of Philando Castile, the black motorist killed last summer by a police officer from St. Anthony, Minn., reached a nearly $3 million settlement on Monday with that city.\nThe city of Minneapolis agreed to a $20 million settlement with the family of a woman shot dead by a police officer who was convicted of murder, lawmakers announced on Friday.\nIn May 2019, the ACLU compared these two cases in an article entitled, \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America\":\nOn Tuesday, April 30, a Minnesota jury convicted police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Damond, a white Australian woman. Damond had called 9-1-1 to report a possible sexual assault near her apartment and then approached Noor\u2019s squad car when he and his partner responded to the call. Noor killed Damond, and he deserved to be found guilty. His decision to shoot and kill an unarmed person without warning, apparently because her presence next to his squad car surprised him, is indefensible. But if the races of Noor and Damond had been reversed, Noor might well have gotten away with murder.\n[...]\nThe most recent such prosecution in Minnesota \u2014 of Officer Jeronimo Yanez for shooting and killing Philando Castile, a 32-year old Black man \u2014 ended with the officer being acquitted of all criminal charges. Castile, a registered firearm owner, was pulled over by Yanez in July 2016. Yanez approached Castile\u2019s car and ordered Castile to provide both his license and registration. Castile\u2019s girlfriend and her child were both in the car with him. After handing Yanez his registration, Castile said in a calm tone, \u201cSir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me\u201d--which is exactly what gun owners are taught to do in this situation. Yanez told Castile not to touch it to which Castile replied \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d Castile, who still needed to pick up his license and hand it to Yanez repeatedly stated that he was not and would not reach for his firearm. As Castile reached in the direction of his license, despite these assurances (and the confirmation from Castile\u2019s girlfriend that he wasn\u2019t reaching for the firearm), Yanez wrongly and unjustifiably believed Castile was instead reaching for the gun.\nYanez then fatally shot Castile seven times.\nAt his trial, Yanez claimed that he feared Castile was reaching for the gun. Despite the body camera and cell phone footage that documented the brief 40 seconds of interaction leading up to Yanez\u2019s decision to kill Castile, Yanez was acquitted of all charges as the jury deemed his fear of Castile grabbing a firearm to be reasonable.\nUnfortunately, in the rare cases that officers are actually charged with fatal killings, these acquittals are the norm.\nHrynkiw, Ivana. \u00a0 \"Man Sentenced to Death for Third Time in 1997 Memphis Killing.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 AL.com. \u00a0 8 May 2016.\nBaker, Al; Goodman, David; Mueller, Benjamin. \u00a0 \"Beyond the Chokehold: The Path to Eric Garner's Death.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 13 June 2015.\nLi, David. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond's Family Agrees to $20 Million Settlement with Minneapolis Over Police Shooting Death.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 3 May 2019.\nSmith, Mitch. \u00a0 \"Philando Castile Family Reaches $3 Million Settlement.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The New York Times. \u00a0 26 June 2017.\nSchuppe, Jon. \u00a0 \"From Eric Garner to George Floyd: Protests Reveal How Little Has Changed in 6 Years.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 NBC News. \u00a0 31 May 2020.\nBrooks, Jennifer. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond Settlement Has Unsettling Side.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Star Tribune. \u00a0 4 May 2019.\nPheifer, Pat. \u00a0 \"Justine Damond Fatally Shot Through Door of Minneapolis Police Car, Sources Say.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Star Tribune. \u00a0 17 July 2017.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Hate Group's Memorial to Justine Ruszczyk Damond Removed by Police.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 25 December 2017.\nTakei, Carl; Fernandez, Paige. \u00a0 \"What Officer Noor's Conviction Says About Racism in America.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ACLU. \u00a0 3 May 2019.\nForliti, Amy. \u00a0 \"Activists: Cop's Shooting of White Woman Treated Differently.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ABC News. \u00a0 13 April 2019.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Minneapolis Police Officer Who Killed Justine Damond Given 12-Year Jail Term.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Guardian. \u00a0 7 June 2019.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Rimmer sentenced to death for third time in 1997 \u2026\nIf the problem continues, contact the site owner.\n\n### Death penalty trial opens in killing of Memphis motel clerk\nBy Katie Fretland of The Commercial Appeal\nRicci Ellsworth, a 45-year-old mother of a daughter and son, was dedicated to her job working 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. at the Memphis Inn.\nShe was someone to depend on, said Linda Spencer who managed the inn at Interstate 40 and Sycamore View.\n\"She was honest,\" Spencer said.\nOn Thursday, Spencer testified during the retrial of Ellsworth's former boyfriend Michael Rimmer, who is charged with killing the night clerk who disappeared in February 1997 leaving behind blood and the ring she constantly wore.\nEllsworth's body was never found.\nRimmer was sentenced to death nearly 17-and-a-half years ago and again during a resentencing in 2004. But in 2012, a new trial was ordered. A judge found Rimmer's defense counsel, both in 1998 and at his resentencing, failed to effectively investigate the capital case.\nShelby County Criminal Court Judge James Beasley Jr., a former prosecutor, found that the Shelby County lawyer who prosecuted Rimmer, Thomas Henderson, \"purposefully misled\" Rimmer's defense counsel about evidence.\nRimmer walked into the court Thursday in a beige suit and glasses. He waved to supporters before sitting at the defense table. The trial was attended by Ellsworth's family members seated on the opposite side of the court.\n\"Revenge and robbery,\" prosecutor Pam Anderson, of the Davidson County District Attorney's office, told the jury. \"That's what this case is about.\"\nIn 1989, Rimmer raped Ellsworth and was sent to prison, Anderson said.\nEllsworth forgave him and visited him.\n\"She was a very forgiving woman,\" Anderson said.\nWhile incarcerated, Rimmer talked to another inmate about Ellsworth. He felt she owed him money, Anderson said. In 1996, before he was released from prison, he told another inmate he planned to kill her and talked about how to dispose of a body, Anderson said.\n\"February 8, 1997, was the last time that anyone saw Ricci Lynn Ellsworth alive,\" Anderson said.\nHer son and daughter never heard from her again.\nEllsworth was kindhearted, said her sister, Dianne Faulk.\n\"We were devastated by my sister's murder,\" she said.\nFaulk said there is \"no doubt in any of our minds and hearts, that he did kill her.\"\nOn Feb. 8, 1997, between about 8:30 and 9 a.m., Rimmer came to his brother's house. He was muddy and had a shovel, Anderson said. The back seat was wet. The brother dumped the shovel and it was never seen again, Anderson said.\nRimmer was stopped March 5, 1997, in Johnson County, Indiana for speeding. Blood consistent with the female offspring of Ellsworth's mother was found in the car.\nAnn Calhoun, a supporter of Rimmer who has visited him along with her husband at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution for about three years, said Rimmer did not receive a fair trial, and she believes he did not kill Ellsworth.\nShe described him as a good man who is musically talented and has helped other inmates.\n\"He's not the only man on death row who shouldn't be executed,\" Calhoun said.\nDefense attorney Paul Bruno said two people had something to do with what happened to Ellsworth, but neither were Rimmer.\n\"There is actually no definitive proof that she's deceased,\" Bruno said.\nBruno said one of the inmates who came forward with information against Rimmer had been convicted of eight felony drug offenses. Another had a lengthy history of forgery and a conviction for voluntary manslaughter.\nBruno said a credible witness, an Army sergeant named James Darnell, had been at the motel and saw two men who did not fit Rimmer's description with blood on their hands.\nDarnell saw a person put something heavy into the trunk of a car. The object was wrapped in something cloth-like.\nBruno said Darnell described two men and a composite sketch was printed in The Commercial Appeal.\nA lady in Arkansas identified one as Billy Wayne Voyles. Police put together a photo lineup with 44 white males, including Rimmer, Bruno said. Darnell viewed the lineup.\n\"Of 44 people, who does he pick out? Billy Wayne Voyles,\" Bruno said.\nHe did not pick out Rimmer.\nKatie Fretland is a journalist for The Commercial Appeal covering the legal system.

(AP Photo/Denes Erdos)\nBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 About three months ago, a scandal rocked five-time nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party which prides itself on upholding family values and Christian conservatism.\nAs party leaders attempted damage control after close Orb\u00e1n allies, President Katalin Nov\u00e1k and Justice Minister Judit Varga, were forced to resign over a presidential pardon for a man convicted of covering up a string of child sexual abuses, P\u00e9ter Magyar saw a chance and broke ranks with the party in February.\nIn a matter of weeks, Magyar \u2014 a 43-year-old lawyer \u2014 built a political movement, now poised to become Hungary\u2019s largest opposition force and challenge Orban\u2019s party in the June 9 European Parliament and municipal elections.\nMagyar said in a recent interview with The Associated Press that the upcoming vote was a \u201cprelude\u201d to his planned run in the 2026 Hungarian national elections.\nWhether he can score a win remains to be seen.\nOrb\u00e1n has delivered his Fidesz party four straight wins in Hungary\u2019s parliament since 2010 and secured more than half the vote in the last two elections for the European Parliament. Polls show his party is still expected to outperform opponents despite a dip in popularity and a deep economic slump that have cost the premier thousands of supporters.\nStill, Magyar seized on the growing disenchantment with the populist Orb\u00e1n and breathed life into the existing but inactive Tisztelet \u00e9s Szabads\u00e1g, or Respect and Freedom, party.\nIn a series of widely followed interviews and public rallies, he accused Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of overseeing deep corruption and a pervasive government-controlled propaganda network while presenting himself as a more moderate conservative alternative.\n\u201cOur offer is very simple: We must do something completely different in Hungary,\u201d he said in the interview, adding that Hungarians were \u201cfed up with the fact that there is an economic, political, moral, legal, and subsistence crisis here in 2024.\u201d\nPolls in May showed that Magyar\u2019s party had the support of around a quarter of likely voters for the June elections.\nHowever, voters have been disappointed before.\nTwo years ago, around 2 million Hungarians pinned their hopes for change on a coalition of six opposition parties that had put aside political differences to form a united front against Fidesz in national elections.\nBut when Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party once again won in a landslide, infighting followed, leading to the de facto dissolution of the coalition and a crisis of credibility for the opposition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certain that people are at least as fed up with the opposition parties (as with Fidesz),\u201d Magyar said.\nSince April, Magyar has been touring Hungary\u2019s rural heartland, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hub of support, drawing thousands of curious onlookers in a feat few traditional opposition politicians have succeeded in before.\nAt a rally earlier this month in the city of Debrecen, a Fidesz stronghold, Magyar told a crowd of around 10,000 that \u201cgovernment propaganda\u201d had tried to discredit his movement as \u201cjust a downtown Budapest media hack.\u201d He also criticized Hungary\u2019s opposition parties as having abandoned rural Hungarians.\nThe June elections come while the war in Ukraine rages amid fears Russia could turn its sights on the Balkan region.\nOrb\u00e1n has cast this year\u2019s elections as an existential struggle between war and peace, portraying his party as unique in calling for an immediate end to the fighting in Ukraine. Critics say this would allow Russia to retain territories it has occupied and embolden it further.\nThe long-standing prime minister has maintained his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin even after Moscow launched its military operation against Ukraine in 2022, and accused the United States and the EU of being \u201cpro-war,\u201d and his domestic opponents, including Magyar, of planning to involve Hungarian soldiers directly in the conflict.\nHe has also criticized imposing sanctions on Moscow and threatened to veto EU financial assistance to Kyiv while ramping up energy deals at a time when most EU countries have sought to limit the use of Russian fossil fuel.\nDespite decrying Orban\u2019s dealings with Russia, Maygar shares some of his views that sanctions have disproportionately harmed European economies. He also agrees with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s criticism of Kyiv\u2019s treatment of a sizable Hungarian ethnic minority at Ukraine\u2019s western edge.\nStill, he is unequivocal in pointing out the potential risks if Russia was permitted to retain the Ukrainian territories that it has occupied \u2014 including the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.\n\u201cPutin is the aggressor, Putin attacked Ukraine, and there is no excuse for that. Ukraine\u2019s struggle for territorial defense is absolutely justified,\u201d he said in the interview.\nHungary under Orb\u00e1n has been locked in a protracted struggle with the EU, which has accused him of flouting rule-of-law and democracy standards and failing to crack down on corruption that misuses EU funds.\nSince 2022, the European Parliament has formally considered Hungary a \u201c hybrid regime of electoral autocracy,\u201d no longer qualifying as a genuine democracy.\nThe bloc has withheld some 20 billion euros ($21.7 billion) in funding to Budapest over its rule-of-law violations, which has further hindered its flagging economy.\nBut Magyar said he and his party would \u201cput an end to these completely unnecessary rule of law debates\u201d with the EU, and pointed to the bloc recently releasing frozen funds to Poland only months after the pro-EU Prime Minister Donald Tusk took over from the previous right-wing government.\nIt was a sign, he said, that new leadership could finally bring that money home.\n\u201cI can promise to all Hungarians, and to Brussels, that we will be able to find solutions (for releasing the funds),\u201d Magyar said. \u201cHungary really needs the frozen funds, but the EU also needs a more constructive Hungary.\u201d\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

One month into the shutdown, the city is as complex as it ever was.\nA postal worker in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan.Credit...Brittainy Newman/The New York Times\nSupported by\nBy Corina KnollAzi PaybarahJacob Meschke and Elaine Chen\nNew York City has never looked so unlike itself. Deserted streets and vacant stores. Essential workers taking to lonely subways. Mandatory face coverings.\nBut beyond the changes we can see outright are other lifestyle shifts that reflect the struggles and needs that have emerged within the last month.\nUnemployment, of course, is up, and the number is staggering. With the state\u2019s shutdown extended until at least May 15, it is a desperate time for many.\nBut some of the data shows glimmers of hope. While hundreds of food banks were forced to close, the city\u2019s volunteer pool vastly expanded. Air pollution is down. Applications to foster abandoned animals skyrocketed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOur altered city, by the numbers, is just as complex as the one we remember.\nDuring the week of March 22, nearly 144,000 unemployment claims were made in New York City. That constituted a 2,637 percent increase from last year, when the same time frame yielded about 5,300 claims.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of food banks that have closed. Thirty-seven percent of all food banks have closed, not just of City Harvest food banks.\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

Neither the photo nor the mail service is mentioned, but the photo has plenty to say about the impact of the virus on the postal service.\nThe caption simply identifies \u201cA postal worker in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan.\u201d The context, given he\u2019s alone, masked, and resting, is that postal workers, too, are giving their all on the COVID-19 front lines. But there\u2019s more visually and politically going on here. For many reasons, including the enabling of big business, the undermining of public unions and benefits, and the latest, undermining vote-by-mail, the White House and conservatives are intent on eliminating the postal service. It\u2019s just one more thing on the pandemic agenda. The administration has blocked emergency funding for the USPS in the virus relief packages, and the service\u2013which has seen business fall off a cliff with the COVID-19 crisis\u2013has gone without federal support for 14 years.\nSo it\u2019s no wonder, with the rolling cart, the large plastic bag and the garbage cans behind it, paired with the mailman\u2019s makeshift seat on the street corner, that the photo bears all the trappings of homelessness\u00a0 (-Michael Shaw)\n\u2800\nPhoto: Brittainy Newman/New York Times \u2800\nView in Instagram\nMichael Shaw\nSee other posts by Michael here.\nFollow us on Instagram (@readingthepictures) and Twitter (@readingthepix), and subscribe to our newsletter.\nA curated collection of pieces related to our most-popular subject matter.",

It purported that on her first full day in office, Harris had threatened that \"we will use federal law enforcement and the military\" against \"Trumpers ... [who] will beg me for a loaf of bread\":\n\u201cThese Trumpers, think we care about the constitution. We have the power now, it\u2019s time to end this. They really don\u2019t get. We will block them in the courts, we will use federal law enforcement and the military. After Joe inflicts the death blow, I\u2019ll take the reigns [sic]. They will beg me for a loaf of bread.\u201d\nWe found no documentation that Harris said any such thing, however. Such controversial comments certainly would have been widely reported, yet a simple search turns up not a single related news account. Nor did any similar statement appear in Harris' social media accounts or in White House briefing room statements.\nThe meme claims the statement in question was made on Jan. 21, the first full day of the Biden-Harris administration, but Harris' recorded events that day were speaking briefly to the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting (during which she made no such comments) and participating in a call with World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHarris had delivered her first speech as vice president the day before, on Inauguration Day, but in that address she made no mention of former President Donald Trump or his supporters.\nBecause we could find no evidence whatsoever of this quotation's being legitimate, we rate this item \"False.\"\nDavid Mikkelson founded the site now known as snopes.com back in 1994 as a creative outgrowth of his wide-ranging interests in a variety of subjects (particularly folklo ... read more\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Did Biden Sign an Executive Order Allowing the U.S. to Fund \u2026\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nThis article was originally published on Feb. 7, 2021 with a rating of \"Mostly True.\"\u00a0 This rating was incorrect, as our original reasoning conflated the Helms Amendment with the Global Gag Rule. Our corrected fact check, now rated \"False,\" is below:\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan first instituted the \u201cMexico City policy\u201d \u2014\u00a0 commonly referred to as the \u201cglobal gag rule.\u201d The policy mandates that the U.S. not fund any NGO or organization that uses any of their money (regardless of where it came from) to advocate for or perform abortions. In other words, if your NGO wants money from the U.S., its entire operating budget must not include anything having to do with abortion. Since 1984, this policy has been rescinded during Democratic presidential administrations and reinstated during Republican ones. Following that historical tradition, Biden rescinded the rule in January 2021.\nHowever, the global gag rule concerns only how NGOs use their non-U.S. funding. The federal government had already banned the direct funding of abortions abroad through the 1973 Helms Amendment. That law remains on the books today, and it requires an act of Congress to overturn. It cannot \u2014 unlike the global gag rule \u2014 be rescinded by executive order. For that reason, it is false to suggest that Biden \"signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to fund abortions abroad.\" More accurately stated, Biden rescinded a policy that blocked non-abortion funds to go to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions with their non-U.S. derived money.\nBiden also signed executive orders reviewing other abortion restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, which reinstated the global gag rule in January 2017. Trump further expanded anti-abortion policies abroad in March 2017 by blocking U.S. funds to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which oversees issues related to abortion. The UNFPA is that body\u2019s \u201csexual and reproductive health agency\u201d whose \u201cmission is to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person\u2019s potential is fulfilled.\u201d\nIn 2019, Trump instituted a federal rule that has been described as the \u201cdomestic gag rule\u201d \u2014 a policy that seeks to bar organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. \u201cOrganizations that receive federal funds have already been prohibited for years from using that money to finance abortion services,\u201d the New York Times explained, but this Trump rule went \u201ca step further by ordering them to keep separate books for their abortion operations.\u201d Biden took action on these moves as well, as reported by the Washington Post:\n[Biden] directed the Department of Health and Human Services to review a rule instated by Trump that cut off federal funding for domestic family planning programs involved with abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and ordered the restoration of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which Trump had cut in a dispute over abortion provisions.\nNone of these moves by Biden, however, authorize the United States government to fund abortions abroad. Such funding has been banned since 1973 and requires Congress, not Biden, to reverse. As such, the claim is \"False.\"\nCORRECTION [Feb. 8, 2021]: Changed rating from MOSTLY TRUE to FALSE after correcting a factual error in our original piece.\nAlex Kasprak is an investigative journalist and science writer reporting on scientific misinformation, online fraud, and financial crime.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Joe Biden & Abortion: Executive Order Reverses Pro \u2026\nNational Review\nEd Feulner\u2019s Fundamental Decency\nEd Feulner Showed Us How to Build. Now It\u2019s Our Turn\nRemembering Ed Feulner\nUltimately, Math Ended The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\nHelp Us Get to $50,000\nPresident Biden signed an executive order Thursday afternoon reversing the Mexico City policy, permitting U.S. aid money once again to fund groups that provide or promote abortion around the globe.\nThe policy was first put in place by President Ronald Reagan in an effort to ensure that taxpayers were not required to indirectly fund abortion procedures performed in other countries. The policy has been undone via executive order by every subsequent Democratic administration and reinstated by each Republican one.\nThe Trump administration expanded the policy to include not only family planning funds distributed by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development but also all foreign-health assistance provided by government agencies, including the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, and the Defense Department. That expanded policy, \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\u201d increased the amount of U.S. funding covered by the abortion prohibition from about $600 million to nearly $9 billion.\nAbortion advocates and interest groups in the U.S. oppose the Mexico City policy; Planned Parenthood, for instance, has labeled it a \u201cglobal gag rule.\u201d During the presidential primary, the Biden campaign promised that his administration would undo the policy and permit U.S. aid money to fund abortions.\nBut according to public-opinion polls, most Americans don\u2019t want the U.S. to fund abortions in other countries. A new poll out yesterday from Marist and the Knights of Columbus found that more than three-quarters of Americans oppose using U.S. aid money to fund abortions overseas. The same survey shows that voters in Biden\u2019s own party disagree with him on this issue: A slight majority of Democrats said they do not want the U.S. funding global abortions, and nearly two-thirds of self-described pro-choice Americans agreed. Eighty-five percent of independent voters, meanwhile, said they oppose U.S. funding of overseas abortions.\n\u201cThese pro-abortion executive orders from President Biden shock the conscience,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) said in a statement shortly after Biden signed today\u2019s executive orders. \u201cOur government shouldn\u2019t be funding abortions at home, let alone overseas. Unity is important at times like these, but waging a culture war is only going to deepen divides and hurt innocent victims. Human dignity matters \u2014 President Biden should rethink this move.\u201d\nSenator Steve Daines (R., Mont.), who founded and chairs the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, said in a statement that Biden\u2019s pro-abortion orders show \u201ca complete lack of respect for the sanctity of human life.\u201d\n\u201cThese actions will enrich Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry at the taxpayers\u2019 expense, while endangering the most vulnerable,\u201d Daines added. \u201cThe United States should not be promoting a radical abortion agenda throughout the world, we should be leading the fight to protect the unborn and all life.\u201d\nHouse minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) also criticized Biden\u2019s move. \u201cKilling unborn children isn\u2019t health care, and violating the rights of conscience of millions of Americans by using taxpayer money to help promote abortions isn\u2019t freedom of choice,\u201d McCarthy said in part of his statement. \u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s so-called \u2018unity\u2019 agenda continues to fail the American people. These one-sided orders are another move by the current administration to appease the liberal activists and neglect the most basic moral and fundamental principles of our nation\u2019s founding.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just that European nations aren\u2019t having children. They\u2019re increasingly preventing the children they do have from being born.\nHis passing is a loss for the movement he did so much to build.\nThis husband-and-wife team has produced a treasure trove of picture books.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is motivated by a desire to bring about the end times and usher in an everlasting Islamic imperium.\nThey don\u2019t even have to get out of bed; someone in the press is already hard at work for them.\nTo prevent blackouts, it\u2019s necessary to stop the subsidy-fueled expansion of wind and solar projects \u2014 which is what the bill does.\n\u00a9 2025 National Review\nNewsletters\n\u00a9 2025 National Review",

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. Regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, he was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the award. Lamar's music, rooted in West Coast hip-hop, features conscious, introspective lyrics, with political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture.\nBorn in Compton, California, Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005 and co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy there. Following the 2011 release of his alternative rap debut album Section.80, Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album on the US Billboard 200. Rolling Stone named it the greatest concept album of all time. In 2015, Lamar scored his first US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\", and released his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), which infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk, and soul, and became his first of six consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200.\nLamar's critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second US number one single, \"Humble\". He curated original songs for the soundtrack of the 2018 film Black Panther, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the US top ten single \"All the Stars\". His fifth album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), delved into introspection and concluded his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His 2024 feud with Drake and sixth album GNX (2024) spawned the US number-ones \"Like That\", \"Not Like Us\", \"Squabble Up\" and \"Luther\" with the second winning a joint-record five Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and the lattermost becoming Lamar's longest-charting number one song on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 13 weeks on top of the chart.\nLamar has received various accolades, including 22 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, five American Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins), and a record 37 BET Hip Hop Awards. Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. His Super Bowl LIX halftime show in 2025 broke viewership records, with 133.5 million viewers domestically. Outside of music, Lamar co-founded the creative company PGLang and ventured into film with his longtime creative partner, Dave Free.\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California.[1] He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth \"Kenny\" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from South Side, Chicago.[2] When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples.[3] Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations.[4] He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother.[2][5] Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (n\u00e9e Duckworth).[6] His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem.[7]\nLamar and his family lived in Section 8 housing, were reliant on welfare and food stamps, and experienced homelessness.[8][9] Although he is not a member of a particular gang, he grew up with close affiliates of the Westside Pirus.[3] Despite suffering hardships, Lamar remembered having \"good memories\" of his childhood that sparked his interest in hip hop music, such as sneaking into his parents' house parties.[2][10] He was raised secular, although he occasionally attended church services and was taught the Bible by his grandmother.[11] He felt \"spiritually unsatisfied\" as a child due to the \"empty\" and \"one-sided\" nature of the sermons.[12]\nAfter hearing a recording of his voice for the first time, Lamar became interested in rapping.[13] He was introduced to police brutality after experiencing the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[2] When he was five years old, Lamar witnessed a murder for the first time while sitting outside of his apartment unit, as a teenage drug dealer was killed in a drive-by shooting.[2] \"It done something to me right then and there,\" Lamar later admitted to NPR Music. \"It let me know that this is not only something that I'm looking at, but it's something that maybe I have to get used to.\"[14] His parents nicknamed him \"Man-Man\" due to his precocious behavior, although he confessed it \"put a stigma on the idea of me reacting as a kid sometimes\u2014I would hurt myself and they would expect me not to cry.\"[15]\nIn school, Lamar was a quiet and observant student who excelled academically and had a noticeable stutter.[16] His first grade teacher at Robert E. McNair Elementary School encouraged him to become a writer after she heard him correctly use the word \"audacity\".[17] As a seventh grade student at Vanguard Learning Center, Lamar was introduced to poetry by his English teacher, Regis Inge.[18] Inge integrated the literary form into his curriculum as a response to the growing racial tensions amongst his students. Through its connection to hip hop, Lamar studied rhymes, metaphors and double entendres, which made him fall in love with songwriting: \"You can put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you. I liked that.\"[2][18] Instead of completing assignments for other classes, Lamar would scribe lyrics in his notebooks.[18] His initial writing was entirely profane, but it helped him manage his psychological trauma and depression, which he struggled with during his adolescence.[18][19] Inge played a vital role in his intellectual growth, often criticizing his lexicon and suggesting prompts to strengthen his prose.[18]\nLamar later attended Centennial High School.[20] He was enrolled in summer school during the tenth grade, which he dreaded because it forced him to be embroiled in a gang war.[20] Despite his efforts to avoid them, Lamar soon became heavily involved with Compton's hedonistic gang culture, which led to numerous health scares and encounters with the police.[2] He distanced himself from the lifestyle following an intervention staged by his father.[5] When he was 16, Lamar was baptized and converted to Christianity following the death of a friend.[21][22] He graduated from high school in 2005 as a straight-A student.[23][24] He considered studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.[2][25]\nDuring high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school.[26] His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap.[26] They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip-hop and the television sitcom Martin.[26] They recorded music together at Free's makeshift garage studio and at his older brother's Hyde Park apartment.[26] Lamar's earliest performances were held at a \"super hood\" comedy club and behind a tattoo parlor.[26] Free was his hype man during that time, while his older brother was his manager and disc jockey.[26] Lamar recorded five mixtapes throughout the 2000s; his first, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik.[27] The mixtapes primarily consisted of freestyles over the production of popular hip-hop songs.[27]\nIn a series of retrospective reviews for Rolling Stone, Mosi Reeves complimented Lamar's \"unerring\" sense of rhythm and timing found in Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year, but criticized his \"clumsy\" lyricism and that his flow was \"overly beholden to ... Jay-Z and Lil Wayne\".[27] Free, who was working as a computer technician, introduced the mixtape to record producer Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith while attempting to repair his computer.[28] Tiffith was impressed with Lamar's burgeoning abilities and invited him to partake in an audition process for entry into his newly established independent record label, Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE).[28] During his audition, Lamar freestyled for Tiffith and record executive Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson for two hours, a strategy that impressed Henderson but bewildered Tiffith.[5][29] He was offered a recording contract by TDE in 2005, joining Jay Rock as the label's first signings.[5] Upon signing, he purchased a minority stake in the label for an undisclosed amount.[29]\nLamar had a brief stint as a security guard when he started working on music with Jay Rock at TDE's in-house recording studio.[30][24] The bond he formed with him, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q led to the formation of the hip-hop supergroup, Black Hippy.[31] Lamar released his second mixtape, Training Day, on December 30, 2005.[27] Reeves complemented its varied production and \"well-executed\" concept, which was based on the 2001 film.[27] In 2006, Lamar signed an artist development deal with Def Jam Recordings and was featured on two singles by the Game. He also heavily contributed to Jay Rock's first two mixtapes, Watts Finest Vol. 1 and Watts Finest Vol. 2: The Nickerson Files.[15][32] Lamar was ultimately let go from Def Jam after an encounter with its president and chief executive officer, Jay-Z; he later described it as \"one of those situations where I wasn't ready.\"[33][34] Lamar and Jay Rock released a collaborative mixtape, title No Sleep 'til NYC, on December 24, 2007.[27] Reeves thought the project was a \"fun cypher session, nothing more, nothing less.\"[27]\nLamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign.[35] Reeves felt that the mixtape was a \"wrongheaded homage to a year-old, well-worn album.\"[27] From February to July, he toured with the Game on his LAX Tour as a hype man for Jay Rock.[36][37] Lamar disliked how his stage name diverted attention away from his true identity, and decided to retire it.[38] He opted to use his first and middle names professionally and regards the name change as part of his career growth.[39] For his eponymous debut extended play (2009),[40] Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production.[27] Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone.[27] He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4.[27]\nAfter striking a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music,[41] Lamar released his fourth mixtape, Overly Dedicated, on September 14, 2010. It was his first project to be purchased through digital retailers.[42] Reeves described Overly Dedicated as a partial \"victory lap\" that marked a shift in his songwriting.[27] The mixtape peaked at number 72 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[43] Lamar served as Jay Rock's hype man for a second time during Tech N9ne's Independent Grind Tour, where Overly Dedicated was introduced to Dr. Dre.[44][45] After watching the music video for the song \"Ignorance Is Bliss\" on YouTube, he reached out to Lamar with hopes of working with him and Snoop Dogg on his unfinished album, Detox.[44][46] He also considered signing him to his record label, Aftermath Entertainment, and was encouraged to by artists such as J. Cole.[47][48]\nLamar entered a brief relationship with Nitty Scott,[49][50] and was featured on XXL's 2011 Freshman Class list.[51] He released his debut studio album, Section.80, on July 2, 2011,[52] which was supported by its lead single \"HiiiPower\".[53] The album explored conscious and alternative hip-hop styles and experimented with \"stripped-down\" jazz production.[54][55] Ogden Payne of Forbes considers it to be \"the genesis to [Lamar] successfully balancing social commentary with mass appeal.\"[56] Section.80 marked Lamar's first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 113. It sold approximately 5,000 copies in its first week of tracking, with minimal coverage from mainstream media outlets.[57] To promote the album, Lamar performed at small venues and college campuses across the U.S.[58][59] He was dubbed the \"New King of the West Coast\" by Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and the Game during a performance in West Los Angeles.[60][61] Throughout the year, he appeared on the Game's The R.E.D. Album, Tech N9ne's All 6's and 7's, 9th Wonder's The Wonder Years, and Drake's Take Care.[62]\nLamar began planning his second album before Section.80 was released.[63] From February to April 2012, he opened for Drake on his Club Paradise Tour.[64] He began working with J.

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune applauded him for giving gangsta tropes a \"twist, or sometimes upend[ing] them completely\" on a record that \"brims with comedy, complexity and the many voices in [Lamar's] head.\"[77] The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 242,000 copies sold;[78] the highest first-week album sales of the year by a male rapper.[79] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City surpassed The Eminem Show (2002) to become the longest-charting hip-hop studio album on the Billboard 200.[80] In October 2022, it became the first hip-hop studio album to spend over ten consecutive years on the chart.[81]\nFrom September to October 2012, Lamar headlined the BET Music Matters Tour with Black Hippy and Stalley.[82] He won Lyricist of the Year at the BET Hip Hop Awards,[83] and was featured on ASAP Rocky's single \"Fuckin' Problems\" alongside Drake and 2 Chainz, which reached the top 10 in the U.S.[84] Lamar embarked on two headlining concert tours in 2013: a national college tour with Steve Aoki and his first international tour.[85][86] He struggled with depression, survivor's guilt and suicidal ideation during promotional events upon learning of the deaths of three close friends.[87] From October to December 2013, Lamar opened for Kanye West on his Yeezus Tour, despite disapproval from his label and management team.[88][89] He was baptized for a second time during the beginning of the tour, and experienced a nervous breakdown near the end.[90][91] Lamar won three awards each during the BET Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards,[92][93] including Best New Artist at the former.[94][95]\nLamar was featured on six songs throughout the year: \"YOLO\" by the Lonely Island featuring Adam Levine,[96] the remix of \"How Many Drinks?\" by Miguel,[97] \"Collard Greens\" by Schoolboy Q,[98] \"Control\" with Big Sean and Jay Electronica,[99] \"Give It 2 U\" by Robin Thicke featuring 2 Chainz,[100] and \"Love Game\" by Eminem.[101] His performance on \"Control\" was described as a \"wake up call\" for the hip-hop industry and commenced his decade-long feud with Drake.[102] Rolling Stone noted that his verse made the track one of the most important hip-hop songs of the last decade.[103] Lamar was named Rapper of the Year by GQ during their annual Men of the Year edition.[104] Following the issue's release, Tiffith pulled him from performing at GQ's accompanying party and accused Steve Marsh's profile on him of containing \"racial overtones\".[105][106]\nAfter his opening stint for the Yeezus Tour ended, Lamar began work on his third album.[89] He earned seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (January 2014), including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Album of the Year for Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.[107] He was winless at the ceremony, which several media outlets felt was a snub.[108][109] Macklemore, who won Best New Artist and Best Rap Album, shared a text message that he sent Lamar after the ceremony ended, in which he apologized for winning over him.[110] The incident was the subject of widespread media attention, controversy and Internet memes.[111] During the awards ceremony, Lamar performed a mashup of \"M.A.A.D City\" and \"Radioactive\" with rock band Imagine Dragons, which was met with critical acclaim.[112][113]\nLamar opened for Eminem on the Rapture Tour from February to July 2014.[114][115] On August 9, he premiered the short film M.A.A.D, which he starred in, commissioned and produced, during the Sundance Institute's Next Fest.[116] He released \"I\" as the lead single to his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, on September 23, which won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[117][118] His performance of \"I\" during his appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live was lauded by contemporary critics.[119] Lamar was featured on three songs in 2014: \"It's On Again\" by Alicia Keys,[120] \"Babylon\" by SZA,[121] and \"Never Catch Me\" by Flying Lotus.[122] He won Lyricist of the Year for the second consecutive time at the BET Hip Hop Awards.[123]\nOriginally scheduled to arrive at a later date, To Pimp a Butterfly was released on March 15, 2015.[124] The album incorporated various genres synonymous with African American music, such as jazz, funk, and soul.[125] To capture its essence, Lamar recruited producers such as Sounwave, Pharrell Williams, Terrace Martin, and Thundercat.[126] Whitney Alford, Lamar's fianc\u00e9e, contributed background vocals on select tracks.[127] Other singles from the album were \"The Blacker the Berry\",[128] \"King Kunta\",[129] \"Alright\", and \"These Walls\"\u2013all of which enjoyed moderate commercial success.[130] Selling 324,000 copies in its first week, To Pimp a Butterfly became Lamar's first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart.[131][132] Billboard commented that \"twenty years ago, a conscious rap record wouldn't have penetrated the mainstream in the way [Lamar] did with To Pimp a Butterfly.

You know, you don't want to see nothing happen to them, but you know he's dangerous.\"[282]\nTupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal life.[283] One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single \"California Love\" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet.[10] Lamar has described himself as an \"offspring\" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views.[284] Although some publications have regarded him as the Shakur of his generation,[285][286] he has strived to maintain his individuality.[287]\nShakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996), The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death (1997), and DMX's It's Dark and Hell Is Hot (1998) influenced Lamar's artistic direction: \"I don't look at these albums like just music; it sounds like an actual film.\"[288] He also listened and took influence from Mos Def and Snoop Dogg during his childhood,[289] and said, \"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy-E.\"[290] 50 Cent's mixtape success inspired Lamar to become an independent artist,[5] while his view on being categorized as a conscious rapper, \"Yeah, I'm a conscious artist because I have a conscience\", gave him a sense of perspective.[291]\nProdigy of Mobb Deep was a key influence on Lamar's earlier mixtapes,[292] while his rapping technique was stemmed from Lil Wayne and his longevity.[293] Eminem and his 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP introduced him to songwriting elements, such as ad-libs, and impacted his aggressive approach to records such as \"Backseat Freestyle\".[294][295][296] He took inspiration from N.W.A's tenacity of representing his hometown with \"courage, honesty and artistic brilliance\".[297] Various R&B and soul artists, including Marvin Gaye,[298] the Isley Brothers,[298] Michael Jackson,[299] Teddy Pendergrass,[300] Sade, and Anita Baker, have influenced Lamar.[301] He performed with Prince, who impacted his vocal register,[302] at Paisley Park to celebrate the release of the latter's 2014 albums Plectrumelectrum and Art Official Age, which GQ described as \"five minutes of brilliant insanity\".[303] To Pimp a Butterfly was influenced by the works of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and funk collective Parliament-Funkadelic.[304]\nThe nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as \"anti-flamboyant, interior and complex.\"[305] He is rooted in West Coast hip hop,[306] and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres.[307] Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist.[308] He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, \"You really can't categorize my music, it's human music.\"[309] PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be.[310]\nLamar did not care for music production during the beginning of his career.[311] However, as he placed an emphasis on songwriting and \"making material that's universal\", he grew more exacting and adventurous with his compositions.[311] He is heavily involved with every aspect of his production process, including the mixing and mastering stages, and is known for working long hours in the recording studio.[312] \"You gotta be hands on and know the different sounds and frequencies,\" Lamar explained to Variety.[311] \"What makes people move, what melodies stick with you, taking the higher octaves and the lower octaves and learning how to intertwine that in a certain frequency, how to manipulate sound to your advantage.\"[311] Lamar chooses to work with a close-knit team of musicians, rather than constantly seek high-profile talent.[44] He has been working with his longtime producer, Sounwave, since his 2009 self-titled EP.[27]\nKendrick Lamar marked a pivotal change in Lamar's artistry. Unlike his earlier mixtapes, which consisted of freestyles over CHR and urban radio singles, the EP incorporated melancholic and \"doleful\" original production that emphasized his lyrics.[27] Austere jazz production was blended with alternative rap styles on Section.80,[313] with instrumentals drawing from R&B, boom bap, psychedelia, and downtempo.[314] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City abandoned the tastes of contemporary hip hop by exploring a subtle, atmospheric side of West Coast hip hop and gangsta rap.[315][316] To Pimp a Butterfly is an amalgamation of genres synonymous with African-American music, most prominently jazz, funk, and soul.[317][318] It redefined jazz rap by highlighting improvisation and soloing rather than primarily using sampling.[319][320] Minimalist arrangements are incorporated in Damn and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.[321][322] Damn appealed to mainstream listeners through its pop and R&B-influenced production,[323] while the scattered and distorted instrumentals of Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was designed to make listeners feel anxious and uncomfortable.[324] GNX was an homage to the West Coast, with g-funk synths, West Coast-inspired beats and flows, and features from various underground Los Angeles rappers such as Hitta J3, YoungThreat, Peysoh, Lefty Gunplay, Wallie the Sensei, and Siete7x.[325]\nSeveral media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation.[326][327] Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z.[328][329] Described as a \"blazing\" technical rapper and \"relentless searcher\" by The New York Times,[305] Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics,[330][331] while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes.[332] His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires.[332] Some of his rhyme manipulations feature \"flexible\" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use \"rigid\" old school elements recalling the 1980s.[332] Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms.[333] With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range.[334]\nLamar possesses a versatile tenor vocal range[335][336] and a raspy, half-shout timbre, where \"his throat sounds dry and his mouth sounds wet.\"[337] Andr\u00e9 3000 was the first rapper that introduced him to singing sensibilities in hip hop,[338] and he writes melody-driven songs as practice for his albums.[338] Lamar became comfortable with his vocals over time, to the point where he feels confident enough to create singing-based albums.[339] Pitchfork noticed how his harmonies on To Pimp a Butterfly never made him sound alone throughout his \"desolate\" performance; comparing his vocal layering to \"standing in the middle, unnoticed, of a large quarrelsome crowd.\"[340]\nPraised for his willingness to use his voice as an instrument,[341] Lamar adopts different cadences, tones, modulations, and timbres to suggest conflicting personalities, paint distinct emotions, and communicate stories using characters and personas.[342][343] His falsetto register, which he calls the \"ghetto falsetto\",[338] has been likened to Curtis Mayfield's.[344] MTV writes that by manipulating his voice, Lamar calls back to a lineage that runs through James Brown's foundational work in the 1960s, 1970s psychedelia, Prince's \"sweaty\" phantasmagoria in the 1980s, and 1990s gangsta rap.[345] He was ranked the tenth-best solo singer of the 21st century by The Times in 2023.[346]\nBranded as a \"master of storytelling\" by The New Yorker,[343] Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers.[347][348] Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he \"knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great.\"[349] American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also \"a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music.\"[350] Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines.[351] His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most \"consistently poignant\" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device.[351]\nLamar, who self-identifies as a musician and writer,[156] begins his songwriting process with an assortment of premeditated thoughts that he jotted down over the course of one year.[352] His personal experiences are a common source of inspiration, but he also pulls ideas from meeting new people, traveling, and experiencing different cultures.[352] A devout Christian, he additionally shares his spiritual triumphs and struggles on his songs.[353][354] He is an avid note-taker, and has developed keywords, phrases, and sounds to help him \"trigger the exact emotions\" he felt when writing the initial demo.[352] Considered to be a \"radio-friendly but overtly political rapper\" by Pitchfork,[355] and a populist by The Wall Street Journal,[356] Lamar's songwriting regularly infuses political criticism and social commentary concerning African-American culture.[357] Common themes explored include racial inequality, institutional discrimination, and black empowerment.[358] Lamar's critiques has been compared to the State of the Union Address by The Guardian,[359] while Billboard described it as \"Shakespearean\".[360] HuffPost opined that his work is a \"great\" piece of journalism because it \"speaks from the prerogative of black communities facing oppression and directly attacks the institutions responsible for their pain,\" an achievement most reporters cannot attain.[361]\nLamar tries to carry a conceptual idea inside of his music, \"whether it's a big concept or it's so subtle you can't even tell until you get to 20 listens.\"[311] Fans and publications have theorized that his albums are related to different forms of mass media.[362] Section.80 is regarded as a short story collection inspired and themed around events that impacted the millennial generation, such as Ronald Reagan's presidency.[363][364] The nonlinear narrative structure of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City is billed as a coming-of-age short film that chronicles Lamar's harsh teenage experiences in his native Compton.[365][366] Its cinematic scope has been compared to the screenplays written by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.[367][368] To Pimp a Butterfly unfolds as both a poem and blank letter that explores the responsibilities of being a role model and documents life as an African American during Barack Obama's presidency.[369][370] Damn is labeled as an introspective satire that explores the dualities of human nature and morality.[371][372] Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers takes on the form of a theatrical play, with confessional lyrics based on Lamar's experiences in therapy.[373][374]\nInsider Inc. and CNN editors have opined that Lamar is one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, deeming him a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture.[375][376] Throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and events following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, his work has been used as protest anthems.[377] According to American studies and media scholar William Hoynes, Lamar's progressive elements places him amongst other African American artists and activists who \"worked both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture.\"[378] Matt Miller of Esquire opined that in recent years Lamar revived music videos as a form of social commentary.[379]\nLamar's music has frequently achieved commercial success and consistently garnered critical acclaim as well as support from artists who have paved the way for his advancement.[380][381] His Pulitzer Prize win was considered a sign of the American cultural elite formally recognizing hip hop as a \"legitimate artistic medium\".[382] Senior artists such as Nas,[383] Bruce Springsteen,[384] Eminem,[385] Dr. Dre,[386] Prince,[387] and Madonna have praised his musicianship.[388] David Bowie's final album, Blackstar (2016), was inspired by To Pimp a Butterfly, and its producer Tony Visconti praised Lamar as a \"rulebreaker\" in the music industry.[389][390] Pharrell Williams called him \"one of the greatest writers of our times\" and likened him to Bob Dylan.[391] Lamar has also been cited as a strong influence on the works of various modern artists,[392] including BTS,[393] Dua Lipa,[394] Tyler, the Creator,[395] Roddy Ricch,[396] and Rosal\u00eda.[397] Lorde regards him as \"the most popular and influential artist in modern music.\"[398]\nA Temple University course on Lamar's life, cultural influences, and legacy began in the fall 2025 semester.[399][400]\nLamar maintains a low public profile,[401] and is known to be reserved. He is reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media.[402][403] He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his \"Zen-like\" calmness and down to earth personality.[404][405] According to Lamar, he has become \"so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it.\"[406] His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy.[14][407][408]\nLamar's public perception has also been influenced by the various rap feuds he has been involved with.[409][410] Although some journalists declared him the winner of his highly publicized conflict with Drake,[411] some felt that his victory was pyrrhic due to the severity of accusations introduced and the spread of online misinformation.[412][413] Following the release of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, media outlets have described Lamar as the \"modern hip hop messiah\".[414] Some critics dislike his \"grating\" political infusions,[415] causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex.[416][417] However, Lamar has declared himself to be the \"greatest rapper alive\" due to his personal connection to hip hop.[418] \"I'm not doing it to have a good song, or one good rap, or a good hook, or a good bridge,\" he explained to Zane Lowe. \"I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time, you have to challenge yourself and you have to confirm to yourself\u2014not anybody else, confirm to yourself that you're the best, period. [...] That's my drive and that's my hunger, I will always have.\"[419]\nLamar has been described as an \"authentic\" businessman who takes \"calculated steps to establish his brand from the ground-up\" and leaves nothing to chance.[420] He approaches traditional album rollouts with an unorthodox method, using Easter eggs and leaving cryptic messages.[421] Before releasing a studio album, Lamar shares a promotional single taken from \"The Heart\", a timestamp song series designed to \"observe the beating pulse behind his music.\"[422] The vulnerable themes explored on the non-album singles have strengthened his relationship with his \"inquisitive\" fanbase known as Kenfolk.[422][423] His real estate portfolio includes properties in California and New York.[424][425] In 2011, Lamar crafted an original song with record producer Nosaj Thing to promote Microsoft's Windows Phone in 2011.[426] He starred alongside DJ Calvin Harris and singer Ellie Goulding in a marketing campaign for Bacardi in 2014.[427]\nAs a minority shareholder of TDE, Lamar was set to serve as the executive producer for the label's film division.[29] He partnered with American Express on advertising campaigns for Art Basel and Small Business Saturday,[428] and is an angel investor of the music creation platform EngineEars.[429] Lamar has also partnered with several fashion designers and outlets. As a brand ambassador, he was involved with designing sneakers for Reebok and Nike, Inc.[430][431] He developed working relationships with Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose; through their respective eponymous brands, they have dressed him for several public events.[432] For her Autumn/Winter 2023 collection, Twilight Reverie, Lamar worked with Bonner to create the show's soundtrack with Sampha and Duval Timothy.[433][434] Through PGLang, he composed the score and co-designed the stage for Chanel's Spring/Summer 2024 haute couture collection.[435]\nA supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Lamar is a vocal advocate for racial equality.[436] In 2012, he commended Frank Ocean for coming out.[437] Lamar developed a strong friendship with former US president Barack Obama, having worked on a promotional video for Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative.[438][439] He was critical of Donald Trump's first presidency and the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.[440][441]\nLamar has headlined charity concerts benefitting local and international non-profit organizations.[442][443] He donated to the American Red Cross in November 2012 to support victims of Hurricane Sandy.[444] In December 2013, Lamar donated $50,000 to his alma mater, Centennial High School, in support of its music department.[445] He embarked on a small concert tour in 2014, and donated all of the revenue to Habitat for Humanity and his hometown.[446] In July 2017, Lamar purchased a wheelchair-accessible van for a quadriplegic fan.[447][448] He has regularly performed at TDE's annual holiday toy drive at Nickerson Gardens,[449][450] and organizes his own toy drive in Compton.[451] He joined a peace walk in June 2020 to protest against the murder of George Floyd and the killing of Breonna Taylor.[452][453] In June 2024, Lamar spearheaded a $200,000 donation to 20 charities and community initiatives based in Los Angeles.[454]\nThroughout his career, Lamar has won 22 Grammy Awards (the third-most by a rapper in history),[455][456][457] a Primetime Emmy Award,[458] five American Music Awards,[459] 37 BET Hip Hop Awards (the most won by any artist),[460] 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins),[461] 7 Billboard Music Awards,[462] and a Brit Award.[463] As a songwriter, he has received nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.[464][465] At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, Lamar received the most Grammy nominations by a rapper in one night, with 11.[466][143] During the 65th ceremony, he became the first artist from any genre to be nominated for Album of the Year with four consecutive lead studio albums since Billy Joel (1979\u20131983).[467]\nLamar has appeared in various power listings. In 2015, he was featured on Ebony's Power 100 list that honors leaders within the African American community.[468] Time included him on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.[469] He has appeared on Forbes' Celebrity 100 ranking (2019),[470] and its 30 Under 30 list twice in the music category (2014 and 2018).[471][472] Lamar was included twice in Billboard's lists of the greatest rappers of all time (2015 and 2023).[473][474] Complex named him the best rapper alive thrice (2013, 2017 and 2024),[475][476] and included him in their list of the 20 best rappers in their 20s thrice (2013, 2015, and 2016).[477] In May 2015, Lamar was declared a generational icon by the California State Senate for his contributions to music and philanthropy.[478] He was a grand marshal for the Compton Christmas Parade,[479] and was presented with the key to the city of his hometown for representing its evolution.[480] He served as Compton College's surprise commencement speaker on June 7, 2024.[481] Lamar is the fifth man to appear solo on the cover of Harper's Bazaar.[482]\nGood Kid, M.A.A.D City, To Pimp a Butterfly, and Damn were featured in Rolling Stone's industry-voted ranking of the 500 greatest albums of all time and the 200 greatest hip hop albums of all time.[483][484] Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was additionally featured in the magazine's list of the 100 best debut albums of all time, and was named the greatest concept album ever.[485][486] It was named the seventh greatest album of all time by Apple Music in 2024.[487] To Pimp a Butterfly was ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of the 2010s decade,[488] while \"Alright\" was deemed the greatest hip hop song of the streaming era by Spotify.[489] As of February 2023, it is the top ranked album on the online encyclopedia Rate Your Music.[490] Damn is the recipient of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, the first time a musical work outside of the classical and jazz genres was honored.[491][492] Its tour companion, along with the Big Steppers Tour (2022\u20132024), are two of the highest-grossing hip hop tours of all time.[493]\nStudio albums\nHeadlining\nCo-headlining\n\n### Kendrick Lamar Tickets, 2025 Concert Tour Dates | Ticketmaster\nHip-Hop/Rap\nThere are no upcoming concerts in United States\nDon't worry, there are other concerts available below\nAdd-Ons\nVIP\nLineup\nVenue\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium\nAdd-Ons\nVIP\nLineup\nVenue\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium\nLineup\nVenue\nEstadi Ol\u00edmpic Lluis Companys\nLineup\nVenue\nEstadi Ol\u00edmpic Lluis Companys\nLineup\nVenue\nStadio Olimpico di Roma\nVenue\nStadio Olimpico di Roma\nLineup\nVenue\nPGE Narodowy\nLineup\nVenue\n3Arena\nAdd-Ons\nSpecial Entry\nVenue\nEstadio GNP Seguros\nVenue\nAllianz Parque\nVenue\nEstadio Monumental David Arellano\nLineup\nVenue\nVictoria Park - Ballarat\nLineup\nVenue\nClaremont Showground\nLineup\nVenue\nExhibition Park In Canberra\nLineup\nVenue\nGold Coast Sports and Leisure Centre\nAs a multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning artist and co-founder of creative imprint pgLang, Kendrick Lamar has achieved massive critical and cultural success since his debut album good kid, m.A.A.d city was released in 2012.

After kicking off at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the tour covered much of North America through June.\nKendrick brough in so much energy to his performance and SZA brough in such smooth vibe where both artists had their fans singing the lyrics. So worth driving to a completely new state to see these great artists perform and provide hours of music bliss. I still miss being amongst their presence/energy and thanks for bringing out Doja!\nI recent attended the Grand National Tour in Detroit and it was absolutely amazing! This was my first time seeing Kendrick in person and he did not disappoint. I was not a fan of Sza's but I became one during this concert. She sounds like the records, and her production was top notch. I am now planning on seeing Kendrick again in Mexico City.\nI had front row seats to the Detroit show, and it was amazing! The atmosphere was incredible. Kendrick was phenomenal. SZA did a fabulous job, and the crowd was awesome. Great vibes all around. I had the time of my life dancing and rapping along with K.Dot. I dang near lost my voice from screaming so loud. I\u2019ve been a fan since 2011 when I first heard Section.80 my freshman year at Howard. I\u2019m currently a teacher, and I\u2019m so excited to share my photos/experience with my students when school starts! They were so excited when I told them I was going to the concert. I can\u2019t wait to see Kendrick in concert again one day!\nIt was absolutely amazing!! The best concert I\u2019ve ever been to.. I wish I could go over and over again. I had a blast. I only wish I would have waited to buy tickets. I was sitting next to a guy who said he paid $157 for 2 tickets I paid $640 for 3. Other than that it was well worth it!!\nKendrick and SZA were amazing. I truly wouldn't go back to Hershey but overall the concert was IT!!!!!\nThis was a concert to remember! This is my third time seeing Kendrick Lamar. Each time has been different, exciting, and high energy. This time was HISTORIC! First, the format and the back and forth between him and Sza was amazing and made for a good, paced show. Kendrick, even with him being a rapper, gave more than walking back and forth on a stage. I loved the graphics, the background dancers, and the visuals. The battle between him and Aubrey was fanfare; this was the SHOW! I will see Kendrick again and again!\nAbsolutely Amazing Concert. Both Kendrick & Sza Killed It. Flawless Performances. It Was So Good The Crowd Forgot It Was Raining. Lol.\nThe whole show was a vibe!!! Highly recommend. The only annoyance was the girl in front of me bringing a friend who didn\u2019t have a seat in our section and they annoyingly stood in other ppl spaces blocking some of our views. Other than that, the show itself was amazing.\nSaw the show at the Benz in ATL in April. It's now June and I'm still feeling that awesome concert vibe. Not huge fan of either, so didn't know what to expect. I was overwhelming surprised and felt honored to have the opportunity of being in that space with my 2 nephews in their 30's. Nothing but love that night with lots of black excellence. Moment so beautiful, I almost cried.\ud83d\udc99\nI\u2019ve been waiting to see Kendrick Lamar live since I missed him on the Mr Morale tour. He exceeded all expectations with this tour! His stage presence, breath control, command of the stage and the crowd is unmatched he has no peers in the rap game at this point he is levels above everyone else. The visuals, choreography, and stage design were amazing. I was always a SZA fan but seeing her live was beautiful, she was an amazing co-headliner. Seeing both of them together in the prime of their careers is an experience I will carry with me for years. Please come back for a second American leg!\nAb-Soul\nThe Weeknd\nTyler, The Creator\nWiz Khalifa\nAmin\u00e9\nGucci Mane\nBeyonc\u00e9\nLil Wayne\nBy continuing past this page, you agree to our terms of use\n\u00a9 1999-2025 Ticketmaster.

Thank you Kendrick!\nRead more\nReport as inappropriate\nAn all around great show. Dram and YG were impressive opening acts, even tho the crowd was a bit dead until Kendrick showed up. YG played \"Fuck Donald Trump\" which was preceded by a Trump impersonator and was genuinely really surprising and hilarious. Once Kendrick showed up, every seat was filled, it was chaotic, and there was a hell of a lot of screaming. Right before he ascended onto the stage from the little platform in the middle of the stage- which was exactly on time, I should add- there was a really cool showing of this ninja performance, as well as a story-like, cinematic, short where he battled someone, and funny title screens showed up from time to time saying phrases like \"KENDRICK FUCKS SHIT UP\". Similar clips were shown sporadically throughout the show so the crowd wouldn't get bored as they prepared for different parts of the act. It was cool when he got raised on this platform in the middle of the arena to perform \"Money Tree\", but the most beautiful part of the show was definitely when he played \"LOVE.\" and just about every person had their phone's flashlights on, swaying side to side, chanting, \"love me.\" It was stunning. Probably the wildest time, for me, was when he played \"Alright,\" near the end. That song is really emotional for me, and seeing him play it live was magnificent. Not to mention how, just like with every other song, so many other people were shouting the lyrics, words for word. Afterwards, there was \"HUMBLE.\" which Kendrick made the crowd sing the entirety of. It was then played a second time, where he sung along, and then descended back underneath the stage. Lots of people thought it was over, but some friends and I had checked the set-list and knew to stay put. Soon enough, he was right back on stage, and played the final song, \"GOD.\" It wasn't quite as strong of a finish as 'HUMBLE.\" but was nonetheless an undoubtedly great song. If I could, I would experience it all over again, minus the ear ringing that lasted until the middle of the next day, a near loss of voice, and needing to skip the next day of school. Another highlight was seeing the uncomfortable white parents who brought their kids. It was amusing to watch them try to dance, shout-out to those guys. One dad brought this, like, eight year old kid who covered her ears when we screamed (understandable considering how ear-piercing it was, but still), and sat down except for when \"HUMBLE.\" was playing. The dad was on his phone the entire time, though. It was amusing, the concert as a whole was unbelievably fun, I hope anyone who gets to see Kung Fu Kenny at some point has a hell of a good time. Heads up: they may not have the merch you want in your size or even at all, but they have other things that are just as good. Also, eat before you go, the lines are crazy long and the food way is too expensive. Anyway, have a blast, don't say the n-word if you're not black.

Our overheated schnauzer needed a trim, and the government opened up pet groomers just in time.\nBy Hannah Beech\nPhotographs by Amanda Mustard\nBANGKOK \u2014 When the coronavirus lockdown in Bangkok eased a bit after six weeks, the first appointment my family made was not for a medical checkup or a walk in a park.\nInstead, we called the pet salon. Caper, our 9-month-old miniature schnauzer, was desperate for a trim.\nThailand remains under a state of emergency through at least the end of May, with almost no international flights in or out. But because of the country\u2019s low confirmed caseload of virus infections \u2014 about 3,000 cases and 56 deaths, as of Saturday \u2014 certain businesses have been allowed to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene limits.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBusinesses given the green light are most restaurants, cafes and street-food vendors; markets; dining-in sections of supermarkets and grocery stores; public parks and outdoor sporting complexes; hair salons and barbershops \u2014 and pet grooming salons.\nYes, that\u2019s right, pet salons are important enough an industry in Thailand to merit their own category, alongside parks and restaurants.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nHannah Beech has been the Southeast Asia bureau chief since 2017, based in Bangkok.

It can add more bounce and volume to the coat from the roots and prevent tangles and knots. It is recommended for pets during the shedding season as the thick herbal paste can catch and remove their loose hair.\n2.Natural Mud Spa\n\u0e3f440-550\nWe use mineral-rich clay (mud) that can only be found in a few areas in Okinawa. The fine particles of mud penetrate deep into the pores and remove dirt and wastes with a strong adsorption power, giving the skin and coat a firm and glossy look.\n3.Silk Protein Bubble Spa\n\u0e3f385-495\nThe moist and fluffy foam with silk protein gently wraps your pet.

Developed for pets with sensitive skin.\n5.Bi_Carbonate Ion Spa\n\u0e3f385-495\nThe carbonic acid spa is recommended for dogs that have problems with odor even after shampooing, unshiny coat, stickiness, hair loss, matting, skin conditions, allergies, and cold feet, which is common in older dogs, as they improve blood flow and other effects.\n6.Micro Nano Bubble Spa\n\u0e3f165-275\nIt is a spa plan that bathes using hot water with micro-nano bubbles that are gentle on the skin. The micro-nano bubbles make it easier to remove dirt from pores, and gently work on delicate skin prone to problems, body odor, and hair luster.\n7.Amino acid Furmake Spa\n\u0e3f165-275\nUsing the same brand of shampoo + treatment + brushing mist gives a glossy, touchable, transparent and smooth finish that you will experience for the first time.

One popular iteration with more than 30,000 shares was posted by Facebook user Mena Anjos on 19 January 2019 along with the caption (translated via Google) \"You know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships\":\nA number of social media users commented and shared this image with more explicit descriptions of what it supposedly showed:\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships...but it's ok because tourism...looks like terrorism to me...\nThe cruise ship @MSCCrucerosArg discharging its sewers in the port of Punta del Este...\nThis is a cruise ship dumping excrement.\nYou know what this is? It's the discharges from the floating cities they call cruise ships. Disgusting! Boycott until they discharge at port into a waste water treatment facility!\nThis is a genuine photograph showing two dark, brownish clouds in the waters surrounding a cruise ship, but it doesn't document that ship's dumping human waste into the ocean. Rather, it captures a cruise ship dropping anchor off the coast of Punta del Este, Uraguay.\nAfter this image went viral in January 2019 (along with its unsavory claims about waste and pollution,) Alejandro Nario, Uruguay's National Director of the Environment (Dinama), took to Twitter to explain what the photograph actually depicted. According to Nairo, this image captured the cruise ship's starting up its turbines before dropping anchor, and thus the brown clouds visible in the water are sand and mud churned up from the water's bottom, not clouds of human excrement:\nAnte consultas recibidas sobre esta imagen, aclaramos: fue tomada en el momento que est\u00e1n acomodando el barco para fondear, las turbinas de arranque producen turbulencia con las h\u00e9lices, levantando arena y barro del fondo, en una zona de poca profundidad No se trata de efluentes pic.twitter.com/e2LQnTaG5W\n\u2014 Alejandro Nario (@alejandronario) January 11, 2019\nHow do these cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew members on multi-day trips, actually dispose of their waste? A 2017 article from the Telegraph explained:\nAccording to environmental regulatory lead at Royal Caribbean International, Nick Rose, the idea that cruise lines go round dumping stuff in the ocean is just wrong. \"Our multi-stage treatment systems exceed the requirements of all international regulations,\" he says.\nThis is how it is done. For a start, there's a lot of liquid to deal with every day. Even with aeration systems designed to reduce the amount of water coming out of bathroom taps and shower heads, the average ship will use average of 40-50 gallons per passenger per day.\nThe \"grey water\" from galleys, laundries and bathrooms is first mixed in carefully measured proportions with the \"black water\" lavatory waste before bio reactors deep in the bowels of the ship set to work.\nThere, all the nasty stuff is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The remaining liquid is disinfected by UV radiation rather than chlorine or other chemicals that would themselves be harmful to marine life.\nAt this stage, and having been monitored for any remaining bugs such as faecal coliform, it is discharged into the sea \"cleaner than the seawater that it might have started out as before being desalinated,\" according to Rose.\nBecause it is so clean, some ports have given approval for it to be discharged closer than the statutory 12 miles from land.\nAbout three tons of solids left from the original 1,200 tons of waste per day is incinerated or contained until it can be offloaded.\nEl Pais. \u00a0 \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 Son Esas Manchas Que Se Ven Desde lo Alto Alrededor de Los Cruceros en El Este?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 11 January 2019.\nHoneywell, John. \u00a0 \"What Happens When You Flush the Loo on a Cruise Ship?\" \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Telegraph. \u00a0 1 February 2017.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Cloudscape photography - Wikipedia\nCloudscape photography is photography of clouds or sky.\nAn early cloudscape photographer, Belgian photographer L\u00e9onard Misonne (1870\u20131943), was noted for his black and white photographs of heavy skies and dark clouds.[1]\nIn the early to middle 20th century, American photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864\u20131946) created a series of photographs of clouds, called \"equivalents\" (1925\u20131931). According to an essay on the series at the Phillips Collection website, \"A symbolist aesthetic underlies these images, which became increasingly abstract equivalents of his own experiences, thoughts, and emotions\".[2] More recently, photographers such as Ralph Steiner, Robert Davies and Tzeli Hadjidimitriou have been noted for producing such images.\nThis cloud\u2013related article is a stub.

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\n\n### The Alfred Stieglitz Collection | Equivalents\nIn the summer of 1922, Alfred Stieglitz began to take photographs of clouds, tilting his hand camera towards the sky to produce dizzying and abstract images of their ethereal forms. In an article the following year, Stieglitz maintained that these works were a culmination of everything he had learned about photography in the previous forty years: \u201cThrough clouds [I wanted] to put down my philosophy of life\u2014to show that my photographs were not due to subject matter\u2014not to special trees, or faces, or interiors, to special privileges, clouds were there for everyone\u2014no tax as yet on them\u2014free.\u201d[1] Over the next eight years, he made some 350 cloud studies, largely produced as contact prints on gelatin silver postcard stock.\nStieglitz called these photographs Equivalents. More than describing the visible surfaces of things, the works could express pure emotion, paralleling the artist\u2019s own inner state. Stieglitz, along with many of the artists of his circle, argued that visual art could assume the same nonrepresentational, emotionally evocative qualities as music. Indeed, music was an inspiration for the Equivalents, and this is reflected in the early titles he gave them: Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (1922) and Songs of the Sky (1923). Stieglitz did not limit himself to clouds, or allusions to music, in these photographs: one notable work, Spiritual America, shows a close-up of the nether regions of a harnessed gelding (a castrated male horse), the image serving as a metaphor for the artist\u2019s impression of a diminished American culture in the same way that his depictions of clouds represented his emotions.\nStieglitz often presented the Equivalents in series or sets, recombining different groupings of prints for exhibition. Georgia O\u2019Keeffe donated thirty of the works to the Art Institute of Chicago, including Set A, made up of eight photographs, and Set E, made up of three photographs printed from the same negative.\n[1] Alfred Stieglitz, \u201cHow I Came to Photograph Clouds,\u201d Amateur Photographer and Photography 56 (1923), reprinted in Richard Whelan, ed., Stieglitz on Photography: His Selected Essays and Notes (Aperture, 2000), p. 237.\nLate Work\nAlfred Stieglitz\nGelatin Silver Print\nEquivalents",

The lifeboat was on station for the ten years between 1935 and 1945.[1] She is now part of the National Historic Fleet[2] and has been preserved in the RNLI Henry Blogg Museum in Cromer.[3]\nFrom 1923 to the end of the Second World War in 1945 the Cromer station had four motor-powered lifeboats all called H\u00a0F\u00a0Bailey after the donor, Mr Henry Francis Bailey, a London merchant who had been born in Norfolk and had died in 1916.[4]\nH F Bailey was built at the yard of Groves and Guttridge Ltd on the Isle of Wight. Her hull is constructed using double diagonal planking of Honduras mahogany on a framework of teak ribs and beams, with the stem and stern posts and her keel of English oak. The stern and stem posts are grown to the required shape to give the lifeboat its strength and sturdiness. She is 46 feet (14\u00a0m) long and 12\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (3.89\u00a0m) wide. The hull is divided into seven watertight compartments, of which the engine room is one. The hull is fitted with 142\u00a0mahogany air cases, each individually made to fit into its allocated position in the hull. Her equipment included the latest innovations of the time which included a line throwing gun and an electric searchlight.[5]\nRNLB HF Bailey went on to serve Helvick Head Lifeboat Station in County Waterford, Ireland until 1969 when the station was closed. It remained closed until 1994 when it was reopened by the RNLI. The lifeboat stationed there today is an Atlantic 75 and provides cover in the area between Youghal and Tramore Lifeboat Stations.",

Currently, the vast majority of reports on war-related TBIs concern soldiers, and little is known about this condition in civilians.\nMethods: This is a retrospective observational study from the EMERGENCY NGO hospital for civilian war victims in Kabul, Afghanistan. Data were gathered for all adults and children with war-related TBIs admitted between June and November 2021. The study aims to describe the epidemiology and clinical patterns of patients with war-related TBIs in a non-military context.\nResults: Out of a total of 1469 hospital admissions during the study period, 130 (8.8%) were war-related TBIs. Among these, 90 (69.2%) involved a penetrating brain injury. More than one-third of the study population were children aged 14 or younger (36.1%), and the most frequent cause of war-related TBIs was shells (58.1%). The median time from injury to admission was 3 hours (from 30 min to 3 days), with only 19% of patients presenting in the 'golden hour'. Neurosurgery was performed on 38 patients (29.2%), and 55 patients (42.3%) underwent mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 35 patients (26.9%), including 15 do-not-resuscitate cases.\nConclusions: War-related TBIs were frequent among adults and children and had a high mortality rate. With more than one-third of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, our data highlight that the availability of intensive care units with the ability to ventilate patients is of the utmost importance to save lives of civilians in areas of armed conflict.\nKeywords: craniocerebral trauma; critical care; epidemiology; trauma.\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

As generations pass it is incumbent upon their children to sort out what is of value and what is not.\nThe list which follows is a guide for determining what to keep and what to dispose.\nIn general, there are only about 15 events which are sufficiently notable to excite most collectors. Those event not included on the list are considered \u201cgeneric\u201d or \u201catmosphere\u201d issues which, although reporting much on the war, are generally not significant enough to draw the attention of the serious collector.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that graphic appeal tends to trump title. Example: the New York Times remains one of the more notable newspapers of the 20th century, but their headlines were typically conservative, lacking any drama, flash, or graphic appeal. Small town newspapers with dramatic graphic appeal will be more desired.\nIssues which fit the events and criteria noted below could well have collector value. Feel free to send the exact title and date of each along with photos of the entire front pages (showing margins) to: info@rarenewspapers.com\nNote: Perhaps the mostly commonly reprinted issue of the war is the Honolulu Star-Bulletin of Dec. 7, 1941. Most of the issues on the market are the common reprint, still sold at the souvenir stand at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial in Honolulu. See this blog post on how to tell a reprint from the genuine issue.\nTop 15 events of World War II:\n1) Germany invades Poland, 9/1/1939\n* This event marked what many regard as the start of the war. Although not an American\nevent, most collectors want this report among their holdings.\n2) Attack on Pearl Harbor, 12/7/1941\n* Japan\u2019s naval air force attacks military bases on Oahu, Hawaii, thus thrusting the United States into the war. The more dramatic and shocking the wording in a banner headline the better.\n3) U.S. Declares war against Japan, 12/8/1941\n* Just one day after the attack on Pearl Harbor the United States officially declares war against Japan, formalizing America\u2019s entry in the war in the Pacific.\n4) U.S. declares war against Germany & Italy, 12/11/1941\n* The United States enters the war in Europe as well, just 3 days after declaring war against Japan.\n5) Battle of Midway, 6/4-7/1942\n* Just six months after Pearl Harbor the United States scores a major naval victory in the Pacific against Japan. Being a multi-day event, collectors would pursue the best headline near the end of the battle reporting the American victory.\n6) D-Day, 6/6/1944\n* With Axis forces controlling much of Western Europe, this day marks the offensive of the Allied forces in re-taking conquered countries. The word \u201cInvasion\u201d is desired somewhere within the headlines.\n7) Battle of the Bulge, 12/16/1944\n* This was the last major German offensive on the Western Front taking place from December 16, 1944 to January 25, 1945. Issues near the end of the battle which reported an Allied victory would be more desired.\n8) Photo of the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima, 2/23/1945\n* If there was a single, iconic photo of American successes in the Pacific it would be this Pulitzer Prize-winning photo. Many newspapers included it in their editions of a day or two later, many did not. Better if the photo is on the front page, as many newspapers\u2014when using it\u2014did so on an inside page.\n9) Death of FDR, 4/12/1945\n* Although arguably not a true war event, the death of the President who was Commander-In- Chief of the military through almost the entirety of the war cannot be missed as a notable event.\n10) Death of Hitler, 4/30/1945\n* Hitler\u2019s suicide deep inside a Berlin bunker essentially ended the war in Europe as just days later terms of surrender were agreed to by Nazi officials. Most newspapers reported his death on May 2, and a few published the Nazi propaganda report that the Fuehrer: \u201c\u2026has fallen in battle at the head of the heroic defenders of the Reich capital\u2026\u201d. The blunt words: \u201cHitler Dead\u201d are more dramatic than \u201cDeath of Hitler\u201d.\n11) V-E Day, 5/7/1945\n* The official end of the War in Europe. This was one event where newspapers often used patriotic embellishments to celebrate the victory, some multi-colored, some incorporating war photos within letters, etc.\n12) Atomic bomb drop on Hiroshima, 8/6/1945\n* With the war in the Pacific still raging, the first atomic bomb ever deployed was dropped over the city of Hiroshima. Some newspaper down-played the horrific affects of the bomb. More desired are headlines which more accurately reported the incredible devastation.\n13) Atomic bomb drop on Nagasaki, 8/9/1945\n* Just 3 days after Hiroshima, the second atomic bomb was dropped, which prompted the Japanese to pursue surrender terms. Again, bluntly accurate reporting in the headline is desired over a more subdued report.\n14) V-J Day, 8/15/1945\n* Terms for surrender were agreed upon, and the world announced the end of World War II. Much like V-E Day, newspapers typically became very creative in patriotically celebrating the end of the war. The more creative the front page the better.\n15) Formal surrender of Japan, ending WWII, 9/2/1945\n* Signing of the surrender terms happened on board the U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Although most collectors would consider V-J Day as the end of the war, and in many respects it was, collectors often pursue this event as well.\nThere are also 2nd-tier items which could be collectible, but the extent of coverage and graphic appeal are paramount, and in some cases the title/publisher is essential.

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nTrump\nAdministration\nADVERTISEMENT\nSupported by\nBy Peter Baker\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The first time they met was in Germany. President Trump took his interpreter\u2019s notes afterward and ordered him not to disclose what he heard to anyone. Later that night, at a dinner, Mr. Trump pulled up a seat next to President Vladimir V. Putin to talk without any American witnesses at all.\nTheir third encounter was in Vietnam when Mr. Trump seemed to take Mr. Putin\u2019s word that he had not interfered in American elections. A formal summit meeting followed in Helsinki, Finland, where the two leaders kicked out everyone but the interpreters. Most recently, they chatted in Buenos Aires after Mr. Trump said they would not meet because of Russian aggression.\nMr. Trump has adamantly insisted there was \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. But each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship. The unusually secretive way he has handled these meetings has left many in his own administration guessing what happened and piqued the interest of investigators.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s disconcerting is the desire to hide information from your own team,\u201d said Andrew S. Weiss, who was a Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton. \u201cThe fact that Trump didn\u2019t want the State Department or members of the White House team to know what he was talking with Putin about suggests it was not about advancing our country\u2019s national interest but something more problematic.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe mystery surrounding the meetings seems to have drawn attention from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining ties between the president and Russia. And it has generated a furor in Congress, where Democrats are pushing to subpoena the notes of the president\u2019s interpreters or perhaps the interpreters themselves.\nVeterans of past administrations could not recall a precedent for a president meeting alone with an adversary and keeping so many of his own advisers from being briefed on what was said. When they meet with foreign leaders, presidents typically want at least one aide in the room \u2014 not just an interpreter \u2014 to avoid misunderstandings later. Memorandums of conversation, called Memcons, are drafted and details are shared with officials who have reasons to know what was said.\nPresident Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have had at least five face-to-face meetings and nine publicly reported phone conversations since Mr. Trump won the election in 2016.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nDavid E.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nPresident Donald Trump revealed the details of his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.\nTrump told reporters before he boarded Air Force One for an \"America 250\" rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, \"We had a call, it was a pretty long call, we talked about a lot of things, including Iran. We also talked about the war with Ukraine.\"\nTrump shook his head and said, \"I'm not happy about that,\" as the president remarked about the ongoing war he hoped to quickly end.\n\"No, I didn't make any progress with him today,\" Trump said when asked about a potential deal with Putin to end the Russian offensive in Ukraine.\nDuring Thursday's call, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of resolving issues with Iran through political and diplomatic means, according to his foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.\nOn the topic of Ukraine, Ushakov said President Trump reiterated his desire for a swift end to the fighting, while Putin expressed Moscow's willingness to engage in negotiations. However, Putin also made clear that Russia remains committed to achieving its objectives in Ukraine and addressing what he described as the \"root causes\" of the conflict.\nPutin has claimed that he launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 to counter what he called a security threat from Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO and to defend Russian-speaking communities\u2014justifications that Kyiv and its Western allies firmly reject. He has maintained that any future peace agreement must include Ukraine renouncing its NATO ambitions and acknowledging Russia's territorial gains.\n\"Russia will not back down from these goals,\" Ushakov told reporters after the call.\nThe call marked the sixth publicly acknowledged conversation between the two leaders since Trump returned to office earlier this year.\nTheir last confirmed call took place on June 14, just one day after Israel launched an attack on Iran. The renewed contact between Trump and Putin appears to reflect a mutual interest in restoring U.S.-Russia relations, which have sharply deteriorated during the ongoing war in Ukraine \u2014 now entering its fourth year.\nThe Trump-Putin conversation comes just two days after Russian President Putin held his first direct phone call in nearly three years with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThursday's call also follows the Pentagon's announcement that it is temporarily halting shipments of certain weapons to Ukraine. The pause, part of a global reassessment of U.S. military stockpiles, affects deliveries of air defense systems, precision-guided artillery, and other critical equipment. A U.S. official and a former national security official, both speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the types of weapons being withheld, as the Defense Department has not yet disclosed specifics.\nIn his first public comments on the pause in shipments, Trump told reporters Thursday that the U.S. continues to aid Ukraine, \"We haven't \u2014 we're giving weapons, but we've given so many weapons, but we are giving weapons and we're working with them and trying to help them, but ... Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.\"\nUshakov said the recent pause in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was not discussed during the Trump-Putin conversation.\nRussia has intensified its military offensive in Ukraine, making significant territorial gains, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region and the northeastern Sumy Oblast. Russian forces have captured key towns such as Kostiantynivka in Sumy, bringing them within artillery range of the city of Sumy itself. In Donetsk, heavy fighting continues around Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, with Russian troops aiming to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines and advance toward the Dnipropetrovsk region.\nThese advances have been facilitated by Russia's deployment of approximately 50,000 troops near Sumy and the use of small assault groups, drones, and light vehicles to exploit gaps in Ukrainian defenses.\nSpeaking Thursday in Denmark after meetings with key European Union allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he may speak with President Trump in the coming days regarding the weapons' suspension.\n\"I hope that maybe tomorrow, or close days, these days, I will speak about it with President Trump,\" he said.\nEstimates indicate that Russia has suffered approximately 950,000 to 1,000,000 military casualties since the invasion began in February 2022. This includes around 250,000 soldiers killed.\nUkraine has endured substantial losses as well. By early 2025, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with nearly 390,000 wounded.\nThe civilian toll has also been devastating. The United Nations confirmed that, as of April 2025, at least 13,134 Ukrainian civilians had been killed and 31,867 injured. Recent UN reports highlight a 50 percent surge in civilian casualties during the first half of 2025, largely due to intensified Russian missile and drone attacks on populated areas.\nThe conflict is the largest and deadliest in Europe since World War II.\nThis article includes reporting by The Associated Press.\nUpdate: 7/3/25, 6:57 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.\nUpdate: 7/3/25, 7:05 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.\nUpdate: 7/3/25, 7:40 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\nNewsweek Is Committed To Journalism That's Factual And Fair.\nHold Us Accountable And Submit Your Rating Of This Article On The Meter.\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

Barnes and Helene Cooper\nWASHINGTON \u2014 There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desires more than the weakening of NATO, the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.\nLast year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying NATO: the withdrawal of the United States.\nSenior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.\nIn the days around a tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the time, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team, including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington\u2019s influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades.\nNow, the president\u2019s repeatedly stated desire to withdraw from NATO is raising new worries among national security officials amid growing concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to keep his meetings with Mr. Putin secret from even his own aides, and an F.B.I. investigation into the administration\u2019s Russia ties.\nSubscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.\nMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.\nFollow Julian E.

This is not speculation. This is not some guy locked in a basement ranting \u2026 on the internet,\u201d Bolton told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins.\nBy signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use, have reviewed the Privacy Policy, and to receive personalized offers and communications via email, on-site notifications, and targeted advertising using my email address from The Hill, Nexstar Media Inc., and its affiliates\nTrump said he thought \u201cthere was enough time\u201d when asked by a reporter about the decision to remove protection for Bolton.\n\u201cWe take a job, you take a job, you want to do a job, we\u2019re not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives. Why should we?\u201d Trump added.\n\u201cI thought he was a very dumb person, but I used him well because every time people saw me come into a meeting with John Bolton standing behind me, they thought that he\u2019d attack them because he was a warmonger.\u201d\nBolton, a harsh critic of Trump, said in a statement to The Telegraph that he\u2019s making arrangements for private security.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

Bolton confirmed the news to CNN with a statement on Tuesday: \u201cI am disappointed but not surprised.\u201d\nTrump has since defended that decision, calling Bolton a \u201cvery dumb person\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives. Why should we?\u201d Trump said.\nBut critics point out that Bolton, Pompeo and Hook have all faced alleged assassination threats from Iran.\nThe three leaders had taken a hardline stance against Iran throughout their foreign policy careers. Some analysts have speculated whether Trump\u2019s decision to revoke their security details could be a form of retribution for perceived disloyalty.\nOne official from the administration of former President Joe Biden confirmed to The Associated Press, on condition of anonymity, that Trump\u2019s team was well aware of the threats to the three men.\nThat person called Trump\u2019s decision \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d.\nBolton had irked Trump with his public criticism after being ejected as national security adviser in 2019. He had served under previous Republican presidents including George W Bush and Ronald Reagan.\nIn his memoir, Bolton wrote harshly of Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cA mountain of facts demonstrates that Trump is unfit to be president,\u201d Bolton said.\nPompeo, meanwhile, has been less vocal in his criticisms, but he briefly flirted with a possible run in the 2024 presidential election, before low polling numbers sank his hopes. He went on to campaign on Trump\u2019s behalf in 2024.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, from 2017 to 2021, Pompeo and Hook were architects of the US\u2019s stance of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d towards Iran.\nThat period was marked by the US withdrawing from a detail to limit Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons in exchange for relief from devastating US sanctions.\nIt is unclear whether Trump will pursue a similar strategy during his second term.\nBut some experts have speculated that members of Trump\u2019s inner circle\u00a0have become more critical of the interventionist, assertive stance advocated by figures like Bolton and Pompeo.\nTrump had said that Pompeo would play no role in his administration. This week, he also\u00a0announced on social media that Hook had been fired from his presidentially appointed position at the Wilson Center, a think tank.\nDozens of former intelligence officials who had signed a letter in 2020 saying that the Hunter Biden laptop scandal had signs of a \u201cRussian information operation\u201d also had their security clearances revoked in recent days.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

        "article_texts": "### Article contains caption\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn June 2020, a set of images started to circulate on social media supposedly showing screen grabs from an episode of \"The Simpsons\" in which the long-running animated show \"predicted\" the death of George Floyd, a black man whose death while in Minneapolis Police custody sparked nationwide protests:\nThese images do not show a \"prediction\" that \"The Simpsons\" made in the 1990s.\nThe image on the right showing Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man's neck \u2014 a scene reminiscent of George Floyd's death \u2014 while Lisa Simpson stands by holding a \"Justice for George\" sign was created by Instagram user Yuri Pomo. This image did not appear in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" and it was posted to Pomo's Instagram account on May 30, five days after Floyd's death.\nPomo captioned the image on Instagram:\nNormally you\u2019re used to see colorful and cheerful drawings from me, but since i\u2019ve got quite a good audience, i\u2019d like to use it as much as i can in the right way when the situation requires it, and bring something good, and useful with my drawings, and you guys know it.\nEspecially in this exact moment.\nWith this piece i\u2019d like you to think deeply, Taking the chance to bring The Simpsons as an example for the cause. The Simpsons has always been everyone\u2019s childhood, so the message will be clear and strong enough i suppose.\nImagine you\u2019re sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show, as cruel as it has been, no jokes, no irony, nothing that the Simpsons normally has, and what it\u2019s loved for. Imagine that, how would you feel? ... Think about that deeply, and give yourself an answer, no need to add anything else!\nThe above-displayed collage also implies that \"The Simpsons\" predicted that a police station would be lit on fire.\nAlthough a precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was truly set ablaze, the image in this collection does not show that fire. The photograph in the bottom left corner of this collection actually shows an unfinished housing complex. That photograph is available via The Associated Press and captioned as follows:\nA multi-story affordable housing complex under construction near the Third Precinct, burns on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minn. Protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer Monday. (Mark Vancleave/Star Tribune via AP)\nThe image on the top left, showing the Springfield police station on fire, truly does come from an episode of \"The Simpsons.\" However, this image has nothing to do with protests, riots, George Floyd, or police violence. Instead, it refers to a joke \"The Simpsons\" made about police incompetence.\nIn the episode \"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\" (Season 11, Episode 6), Homer decides to bypass traffic by driving along the grassy area next to the highway. He is pulled over by Springfield's Police Chief Wiggum, who asks: \"Alright smart guy, where's the fire?\"\nHomer replies \"over there\" and points to a flaming Springfield police station. Chief Wiggum responds: \"Okay, you just bought yourself a 317, pointing out police stupidity... Or is that a 314? Nah nah, 314 is a dog uh, in, no or is that a 315?... You're in trouble pal.\"\nWe have not been able to find a publicly available version of this clip to share in this article, but here's a GIF capturing the moment:\nIn sum, \"The Simpsons\" didn't predict Floyd's death or the resulting protests or fires. The image of Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man's neck was shared in the days after Floyd's death and didn't appear in an official episode of the show. Although the image of the Springfield police station burning did come from an episode of \"The Simpsons,\" this clip had nothing to do with Floyd or the 2020 protests.\nThe Associated Press. \u00a0 \"Minneapolis Police Station Torched Amid George Floyd Protest.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 29 May 2020.\nBBC News. \u00a0 \"George Floyd: What Happened in the Final Moments of His Life.\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 30 May 2020.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### Did 'The Simpsons' Predict President Trump's Death?\nAdvertisment:\nAbout this rating\nIn February 2017, an image purportedly showing a still shot from an episode of the long-running animated television series The Simpsons, featuring a depiction of President Donald Trump lying in a coffin, was circulated on social media:\nThis image was frequently shared along with messages stating that\u00a0The Simpsons were foretelling President Trump's death, since the show has reportedly predicted so many other major events:\nThe Simpsons have shown impressive ability to predict the future, we have witnessed horrifying events that have come true and that without doubt have passed into history, as in the case of the fall of the twin towers , The emergence of Ebola, video calls, the triumph of Donald Trump as President of the United States and this, just to mention a few, however, recently The Simpsons have brought to light a new prediction that could undoubtedly mark the world and Is the death of the current president.\nThere are several problems with this claim.\nFirst, the above-displayed image was not taken from an episode of\u00a0The Simpsons (nor did it appear\u00a0in an article by\u00a0The Huffington Post\u00a0promulgating this rumor, as the watermark suggests). According to a Spanish-language video from Badabun, which had more than 1 million views at the time of this writing and was largely responsible for spreading this rumor, the image first appeared in a thread on a\u00a04chan.org\u00a0forum.\nAn English-language video was also circulated about this theory.\nIn addition to the unofficial origins of this image, these videos are questionable because they used previously debunked \"Simpsons predictions\" in order to lend credence to their claims. For instance, the clip of Trump's riding down an escalator aired after Trump had announced that he was running for president, not before.\nDan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.\nAdvertisment:\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n\u00a9 1995 - 2025 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\n### No, The Simpsons did not feature Trump in a coffin - PolitiFact\nOur only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.\nWe need your help.\nMore Info\nThat image of Trump purportedly in a coffin in an episode of \"The Simpsons has been circulating for years and has been debunked.\nThe image did not appear in \"The Simpsons\" and while its origins are unclear, it appears to have been promoted on the fringe forum website 4chan.\nShortly after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, Facebook posts started popping up claiming that the long-running TV show \"The Simpsons\" had featured Trump in a coffin.\nThat image of Trump purportedly in a coffin in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" has been circulating for years and has been debunked. Snopes in February 2017 reported that the image did not appear in \"The Simpsons,\" and while its origins are unclear, it appears to have been promoted on the fringe forum website 4chan.\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nEarlier this year, social media posts also claimed that \"The Simpsons\" predicted Trump would die Aug. 27, 2020, and used that same image of Trump in a coffin. \"The Simpsons\" has featured Trump before, but we found no indication that the show aired an episode of him in a coffin.\nBill Oakley, a former writer for \"The Simpsons,\" told the Hollywood Reporter in a story published March 2020 that the show gets too much credit for predicting the future and also didn\u2019t like past episodes being used for nefarious purposes. Facebook posts have falsely claimed that \"The Simpsons\" predicted the coronavirus. We rated that Pants on Fire.\n\"There are very few cases where \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 predicted something,\" Oakley told the Hollywood Reporter. \"It's mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself. Most of these episodes are based on things that happened in the '60s, '70s or '80s that we knew about.\"\nIn his Oct. 2 tweet, Trump said that his wife, Melania Trump, also tested positive for COVID-19. \"We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!,\" Trump said.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\nThe Principles of the Truth-O-Meter\nFacebook post, Oct. 2020\nTwitter, @realdonaldtrump tweet, Oct. 2, 2020\nThe Hollywood Reporter, 'Simpsons' Writer Calls Perversion of Classic Episode During Coronavirus Outbreak \"Gross\", March 15, 2020\nPolitiFact, D\u2019oh, \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 didn\u2019t predict the coronavirus, Feb. 27, 2020\nSnopes.com, Did \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Predict President Trump\u2019s Death?, Feb. 7, 2017\nTwitter advanced search for Trump @TheSimpsons\nIn a world of wild talk and fake news, help us stand up for the facts.\nSign me up\nDistrict of Columbia\n1800 I Street NW\nWashington, DC 20006\nFlorida\n801 3rd St. S\nSt. Petersburg, FL 33701\n727-821-9494",
